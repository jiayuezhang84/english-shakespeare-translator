74,53831-1503842569006-6721," sometime like a philosopher,  with two stones moe than's artificial one: he is  very often like a knight; and, generally, in all  shapes that man goes up and down in from fourscore  to thirteen, this spirit walks in. ","Sometimes, he looks like a philosopher with two testicles to add to the stone he uses for alchemy. A lot of times he looks like a knight, but generally he sticks to the appearances men take between the ages of 13 and 80."
75,A-83610,  Thou art not altogether a fool.  ,You're not a complete fool.
76,A-83120,"  Nor thou altogether a wise man: as much foolery asI have, so much wit thou lackest.  ","And you're definitely not the brightest bulb on the tree. As much as I am a fool, that's how much intelligence you lack."

28,53902-1501007061849-17834," O, may diseases only work upon't!  And, when he's sick to death, let not that part of nature  Which my lord paid for, be of any power  To expel sickness, but prolong his hour! ","I hope he gets a fatal disease , and that whatever part of him existed thanks to eating Timon's food works to make his suffering even more painful."
0,A-21597,"  Who, the Lord Timon? he is my very good friend, andan honourable gentleman.  ",You're talking about Timon? He is my friend and a good guy.
1,53906-1503843940319-28739," We know him for no less, though we are but strangers  to him. ","We've heard as much, even though we've never met the man."
2,53906-1503843961856-11308," But I can tell you one thing, my lord, and  which I hear from common rumours: now Lord Timon's  happy hours are done and past, and his estate  shrinks from him. "," Still, I can tell you something else which I've heard as a rumor: Timon's best days are behind him, and his estate is shrinking beyond his control."
3,A-93055,"  Fie, no, do not believe it; he cannot want for money.  ","Psh, no, don't believe the rumors. He has plenty of money."
4,53908-1503843977988-37088," But believe you this, my lord, that, not long ago,  one of his men was with the Lord Lucullus to borrow  so many talents, ","But, my lord, believe this: one of his men went to the Lord Lucullus to ask for that much."
5,53908-1503843985088-51336," nay, urged extremely for't and  showed what necessity belonged to't, and yet was denied. "," Really, he begged desperately for it, showing just how much he really needed it, and still he was rejected."
6,A-92810,  How!  ,No way!
7,A-78730,"  I tell you, denied, my lord.  ","Yes, totally rejected."
8,53911-1503844009635-73285," What a strange case was that! now, before the gods,  I am ashamed on't. Denied that honourable man! ","That is so weird! God as my witness, I am ashamed to hear that such an honorable man was denied a loan."
9,53911-1503844050095-3547," there was very little honour showed in't. For my own  part, I must needs confess, I have received some  small kindnesses from him, as money, plate, jewels  and such-like trifles, nothing comparing to his; "," There is no honor at all in that, and when I think of myself, I must say I have received many gifts from him: money, silver, jewels, and other things—though nothing compared to what he gave Lucullus."
10,53911-1503844056214-38235," yet, had he mistook him and sent to me, I should  ne'er have denied his occasion so many talents. ","If Timon had foregone Lucullus and asked me for a loan, I never would have denied him so much."
11,A-80747,"  See, by good hap, yonder's my lord;I have sweat to see his honour. My honoured lord,—  ","There you are, my lord, I've been look all over for you. My lord—"
12,A-36634,"  Servilius! you are kindly met, sir. Fare thee well:commend me to thy honourable virtuous lord, my veryexquisite friend.  ","Servilius! It's good to see you. Please, bring me to Timon, my good friend."
13,A-37397,"  May it please your honour, my lord hath sent—  ","If you are willing, Timon sent—"
14,A-87870,"  Ha! what has he sent? I am so much endeared tothat lord; he's ever sending: how shall I thankhim, thinkest thou? And what has he sent now?  ","Ha! What gift has he sent me? I owe that man so much, since he's always giving me gifts. How do you think I should thank him? What has he sent me?"
15,A-99132,"  Has only sent his present occasion now, my lord;requesting your lordship to supply his instant usewith so many talents.  ","Only me to state his current state of affairs, and to ask you to lend him some money."
16,A-70925,  I know his lordship is but merry with me;He cannot want fifty five hundred talents.  ,Timon must be joking. There's no way he needs fifty five hundred talents.
17,A-46283,"  But in the mean time he wants less, my lord.If his occasion were not virtuous,I should not urge it half so faithfully.  ",For now he wants less. I wouldn't speak with such urgency about this if it were a joke.
18,A-47203,"  Dost thou speak seriously, Servilius?  ",You're serious?
19,A-50869,"  Upon my soul,'tis true, sir.  ","Yes, I swear."
20,53923-1502314795780-7768," What a wicked beast was I to disfurnish myself  against such a good time, when I might ha' shown  myself honourable! ","I'm a horrible man for accepting all those gifts from Timon, when I could have been better! "
21,53923-1502314855899-35390," how unluckily it happened, that I  should purchase the day before for a little part,  and undo a great deal of honoured! ",I gave up the opportunity to be a good man for something that brings me no honor! 
22,53923-1502314873516-94145," Servilius, now,  before the gods, I am not able to do,—the more  beast, I say:—I was sending to use Lord Timon  myself, these gentlemen can witness! ","Servilius, I swear to god that I cannot help. I was actually going to send someone to borrow from Timon, and these men here will back me up. "
23,53923-1502314893131-30371," but I would  not, for the wealth of Athens, I had done't now. ",I swear on all the wealth of Athens! 
24,53923-1502314904853-51627, Commend me bountifully to his good lordship; ,Tell Timon what I've said. 
25,53923-1502314924044-38177," and I  hope his honour will conceive the fairest of me,  because I have no power to be kind: "," hope he will think of me well, even if I cannot help him. "
26,53923-1502314958044-44029," and tell him  this from me, I count it one of my greatest  afflictions, say, that I cannot pleasure such an  honourable gentleman. ",Tell him that it pains me more than anything else that I cannot aid such a good man. 
27,53923-1502314966020-26570," Good Servilius, will you  befriend me so far, as to use mine own words to him? ","Servilius, would you be a good friend to me and tell him this?"
28,A-77706,"  Yes, sir, I shall.  ","Yes, I will."
29,A-44587,"  I'll look you out a good turn, Servilius.  ","I wish you the best, Servilius!"
30,A-38483,"  True as you said, Timon is shrunk indeed;And he that's once denied will hardly speed.  ","It's as you said, Timon is poor. And someone who is denied once does not have much hope of prospering."
31,A-46029,"  Do you observe this, Hostilius?  ","Did you see that, Hostilius?"
32,A-69081,"  Ay, too well.  ",Yes.
33,53931-1502314991893-81741," Why, this is the world's soul; and just of the  same piece  Is every flatterer's spirit. ","That's what the world is like, and every flatterer is the same. "
34,53931-1502315148192-90351, Who can call him  His friend that dips in the same dish? ,What is a friend who takes so much? 
35,53931-1502315025078-53399," for, in  My knowing, Timon has been this lord's father,  And kept his credit with his purse,  Supported his estate; ","Timon was so good to Lucilius, and kept him afloat with his own money. "
36,53931-1502315045566-90963," nay, Timon's money  Has paid his men their wages: he ne'er drinks,  But Timon's silver treads upon his lip; ","It's Timon who paid for his servants, and he never enjoys anything that does not owe itself to him. "
37,53931-1502315119335-11182," And yet—O, see the monstrousness of man  When he looks out in an ungrateful shape!— ",But how monstrous he looks for being so ungrateful! 
38,53931-1502315131813-84920," He does deny him, in respect of his,  What charitable men afford to beggars. ",He denies him what rich men would give to beggars.
39,A-19962,  Religion groans at it.  ,It's unholy.
40,53933-1503844108791-11731," For mine own part,  I never tasted Timon in my life,  Nor came any of his bounties over me,  To mark me for his friend; ","I myself have never received anything from Timon, and am not his friend."
41,53933-1503844133670-66405," yet, I protest,  For his right noble mind, illustrious virtue  And honourable carriage,  Had his necessity made use of me,  I would have put my wealth into donation,  And the best half should have return'd to him, "," But I swear on all of his good qualities that if he approached me for money, I would have given him something."
42,53933-1503844139087-58205," So much I love his heart: but, I perceive,  Men must learn now with pity to dispense;  For policy sits above conscience. ", I like him that much. Men don't know how to give and value shrewd money-making over their conscience.
0,53936-1503844204722-26318," Must he needs trouble me in 't,—hum!—'bove  all others? ",Should Timon really have to struggle for this?
1,53936-1503844214469-34207," He might have tried Lord Lucius or Lucullus;  And now Ventidius is wealthy too,  Whom he redeem'd from prison: "," He could go to Lord Lucius or Lucullus for a loan, and he could also call on the rich Ventidius, who is free from prison thanks to Timon."
2,53936-1503844223146-48776, all these  Owe their estates unto him. , All these men owe some of their wealth to Timon.
3,A-14533,"  My lord,They have all been touch'd and found base metal, forThey have all denied him.  ","All those men must be under some wicked influence, because they all denied him."
4,53938-1503844240445-25584, How! have they denied him?  Has Ventidius and Lucullus denied him?  And does he send to me? Three? hum!  It shows but little love or judgment in him:  Must I be his last refuge! ,"No way! Ventidius and Lucullus denied him? Has he approached me for a loan? It shows little Timon's friends loved him that all three of these men refused him, and now I must be his last hope!"
5,53938-1503844263822-86193," His friends, like  physicians,  Thrive, give him over: must I take the cure upon me? "," All his friends benefitted from the charity that leaves him without money, and now leave him for broke like doctor does a case he has deemed helpless. Must I now try to cure him of his debts?"
6,53938-1503844274819-86911," Has much disgraced me in't; I'm angry at him,  That might have known my place: I see no sense for't,  But his occasion might have woo'd me first;  For, in my conscience, I was the first man  That e'er received gift from him: "," What a disgrace and an unenviable position for me! I cannot understand why he did not come to me first—I was the first to receive a gift from him, after all."
7,53938-1503844290344-39279," And does he think so backwardly of me now,  That I'll requite its last? No:  So it may prove an argument of laughter  To the rest, and 'mongst lords I be thought a fool. "," Does he think so poorly of me as to believe I would be the last to repay him? No, and that way I'll have reason to laugh at him and all the others, who have called me an idiot."
8,53938-1503844301802-13942," I'd rather than the worth of thrice the sum,  Had sent to me first, but for my mind's sake;  I'd such a courage to do him good. But now return,  And with their faint reply this answer join;  Who bates mine honour shall not know my coin. "," If Timon had approached me first, I would have three times the amount he asks for. But now, servant, go back to him and tell him this: whoever scorns me this way will never get my money. "
9,53940-1503844316573-93891," Excellent! Your lordship's a goodly villain. The  devil knew not what he did when he made man  politic; he crossed himself by 't: and I cannot  think but, in the end, the villainies of man will  set him clear. ","Wow, what a villain! Even the devil couldn't have known how evil men would be when he made them so crafty. He ruined himself in the process, and there's no way that all the badness in men will ever absolve him."
10,53940-1503844334892-16366," How fairly this lord strives to  appear foul! takes virtuous copies to be wicked,  like those that under hot ardent zeal would set  whole realms on fire: Of such a nature is his  politic love. "," It is incredible how this lord actually works to seem horrible! He makes himself seem virtuous, but only so he can be as wicked as those who would burn entire empires to the ground. That's what political desire is made of."
11,53940-1503844345414-64946," This was my lord's best hope; now all are fled,  Save only the gods: now his friends are dead,  Doors, that were ne'er acquainted with their wards  Many a bounteous year must be employ'd  Now to guard sure their master. "," He was Timon's best chance at getting money, and now all hopes are gone except for the will of the gods. Timon's friends are dead to him, and now all those doors he had left wide open all those years must be closed and used to protect him in his home."
12,53940-1503844351001-45793, And this is all a liberal course allows;  Who cannot keep his wealth must keep his house. , That's what being too generous gets you. He who cannot hang onto wealth must at least hang onto his house.
0,A-91309,"  Well met; good morrow, Titus and Hortensius.  ","Right on time. Good day, Titus and Hortensius."
1,A-42316,  The like to you kind Varro.  ,And you as well.
2,A-15965,"  Lucius!What, do we meet together?  ","Oh, a representative of Lucius! Are you here to see Timon as well?"
3,A-51735,"  Ay, and I thinkOne business does command us all; for mine Is money.  ","Yes. We do all have the same goal, and mine is money."
4,A-91808,  So is theirs and ours.  ,And your goal is our goal.
5,A-34085,  Lucius' Servant And Sir Philotus too!  ,"Not only Lucius's Servant, but Philotus's too!"
6,A-23554,  Good day at once.  ,Good day.
7,A-32185,"  Welcome, good brother.What do you think the hour?  ",Hello. What time is it?
8,A-25657,  Labouring for nine.  ,Close to nine.
9,A-82794,  So much?  ,That late?
10,A-13473,  Is not my lord seen yet?  ,Has anyone seen Timon yet?
11,A-89734,  Not yet.  ,Not yet.
12,A-77987,  I wonder on't; he was wont to shine at seven.  ,I wonder why. He usually wakes up at seven.
13,68419-1503846738483-82066," Ay, but the days are wax'd shorter with him:  You must consider that a prodigal course  Is like the sun's; but not, like his, recoverable. ","Yeah, but the days have become shorter for him, because you should remember that the path of extravagance descends like the sun in winter, even if it does not regain its height the following year."
14,68419-1503846743618-41998," I fear 'tis deepest winter in Lord Timon's purse;  That is one may reach deep enough, and yet  Find little. "," And I'm afraid that Lord Timon's estate is withering, no matter how hard he tries to recover money. "
15,A-44757,  I am of your fear for that.  ,Me too.
16,A-73930,  I'll show you how to observe a strange event.Your lord sends now for money.  ,"And I'll tell you something funny.  Your lord sent you to get money, right?"
17,A-86119,"  Most true, he does.  ",Yes.
18,A-94798,"  And he wears jewels now of Timon's gift,For which I wait for money.  ","And he now possesses jewels from Timon, which I lent him the money to buy. "
19,A-51497,  It is against my heart.  ,"Unfortunately, yes."
20,68420-1503846821235-36659," Mark, how strange it shows,  Timon in this should pay more than he owes: ","It's so weird how Timon must pay out more than he owes,"
21,68420-1503846826273-67908," And e'en as if your lord should wear rich jewels,  And send for money for 'em. ", while your lord seems to get the privilege of wearing the jewels and getting to request the money paid for them.
22,A-67613,"  I'm weary of this charge, the gods can witness:I know my lord hath spent of Timon's wealth,And now ingratitude makes it worse than stealth.  ",God I'm sick of this job. I know that my lord spent Timon's money and now in his ingratitude is as bad as a thief.
23,A-64082,"  Yes, mine's three thousand crowns: what's yours?  ",Yeah. My lord is asking for three thousand crowns. What about yours?
24,A-41624,  Five thousand mine.  , Five thousand.
25,A-53153,"  'Tis much deep: and it should seem by the sun,Your master's confidence was above mine;Else, surely, his had equall'd.  ","Way too much. It seems your master is more brazen even than mine, otherwise mine would have asked for as much."
26,A-85922,  One of Lord Timon's men.  ,One of Timon's servants is coming
27,A-83284,"  Flaminius! Sir, a word: pray, is my lord ready tocome forth?  ",Flaminius! Can we talk for a second? Is Timon coming?
28,A-64976,"  No, indeed, he is not.  ",No he's not.
29,A-92877,"  We attend his lordship; pray, signify so much.  ",At least tell him we are waiting for him.
30,A-56368,  I need not tell him that; he knows you are too diligent.  ,I don't have to do that. He knows how attentive you are.
31,A-68411,"  Ha! is not that his steward muffled so?He goes away in a cloud: call him, call him.  ","Ha! Is that his assistant wrapped up like that? Get him, he's trying to sneak away under cover."
32,A-29833,"  Do you hear, sir?  ","Can we talk, please?"
33,A-71330,"  By your leave, sir,—  ","Please, sir—"
34,A-50521,"  What do ye ask of me, my friend?  ",What do you want?
35,A-99200,"  We wait for certain money here, sir.  ",We want the money Timon owes.
36,53973-1503846857279-35866," Ay,  If money were as certain as your waiting,  'Twere sure enough. ","Yes, if only money were as sure a thing as you all asking for it, then you would definitely have it."
37,53973-1503846883192-54462," Why then preferr'd you not your sums and bills,  When your false masters eat of my lord's meat?  Then they could smile and fawn upon his debts  And take down the interest into their  gluttonous maws. "," Why didn't your masters send you to pay the bills for the food they ate off Timon's plate? That way, they could smile and enjoy the debts he incurred and then shovel all the interest he owed into their greedy mouths."
38,53973-1503846953387-16561," You do yourselves but wrong to stir me up;  Let me pass quietly:  Believe 't, my lord and I have made an end;  I have no more to reckon, he to spend. ","You're not doing yourself any favors riling me up like this. Let me go. My lord and I have parted ways. I have no more counsel to give, and he has no more money to spend."
39,A-38186,"  Ay, but this answer will not serve.  ","Yes, but that still isn't enough."
40,A-83651,"  If 'twill not serve,'tis not so base as you;For you serve knaves.  ","If it's not enough, it's still worth more than all of you, because you serve bad men."
41,A-41363,  How! what does his cashiered worship mutter?  ,What did the fired man just say?
42,53978-1503846964501-18644," No matter what; he's poor, and that's revenge  enough. ","Whatever, he's poor and that's punishment enough for him."
43,53978-1503846973563-80852, Who can speak broader than he that has no  house to put his head in? such may rail against  great buildings. ," After all, who can say whatever he wants more than the man with no home and nothing to lose?"
44,A-73384,"  O, here's Servilius; now we shall know some answer.  ",Here is Servilius. Now we'll know what is going on.
45,53981-1503846984708-5247," If I might beseech you, gentlemen, to repair some  other hour, I should derive much from't; ","If I may ask, gentleman, please come back some other time, and it will help me a great deal."
46,53981-1503846996333-67769," for,  take't of my soul, my lord leans wondrously to  discontent: his comfortable temper has forsook him;  he's much out of health, and keeps his chamber. "," I swear, Timon is extremely upset. His cheerful disposition is gone, he is sick, and he keeps to his room."
47,68413-1503847017112-16861," Many do keep their chambers are not sick:  And, if it be so far beyond his health, ","Lots of people who stay in their rooms aren't sick, and if he's as sick as you say he is,"
48,68413-1503847030128-93360," Methinks he should the sooner pay his debts,  And make a clear way to the gods. ", all the more reason for him to pay off his debts before he dies.
49,A-24408,  Good gods!  ,Good lord!
50,A-82126,"  We cannot take this for answer, sir.  ",We can't accept this.
51,A-34106,"Servilius, help! My lord! my lord!","Servilius, help! Timon! Timon!"
52,53986-1503847044964-12308," What, are my doors opposed against my passage?  Have I been ever free, and must my house  Be my retentive enemy, my gaol? ","What, are my own doors going to shut themselves to me? Am I not free to leave my own house?"
53,53986-1503847056270-89575," The place which I have feasted, does it now,  Like all mankind, show me an iron heart? "," Does the home to such great parties turn its back on me, like everyone else?"
54,A-46594,"  Put in now, Titus.  ",Calm down Titus.
55,A-17003,"  My lord, here is my bill.  ",Here is the receipt for debts you owe me.
56,A-97854,  Here's mine.  ,Here's mine.
57,A-90201,"  And mine, my lord.  ",And mine.
58,A-52936,"  And ours, my lord.  ",And ours.
59,A-25008,  All our bills.  ,All our receipts.
60,A-72924,  Knock me down with 'em: cleave me to the girdle.  ,"Go ahead, kill me with them."
61,A-55026,"  Alas, my lord,-  ",But—
62,A-66501,  Cut my heart in sums.  ,Rip pieces of my heart out.
63,A-85375,"  Mine, fifty talents.  ",My receipt is for fifty talents.
64,A-31460,  Tell out my blood.  ,Count my blood drop by drop and take it from me.
65,A-47445,  Five thousand drops pays that.What yours?—and yours?  ,Five thousand drops should cover. What about all your receipts?
66,A-45225,"  My lord,—  ",My lord—
67,A-16703,"  My lord,—  ",My lord—
68,A-54437,"  Tear me, take me, and the gods fall upon you!  ","Tear me apart and take me away, and may the gods take their revenge upon you!"
69,A-90558,"  'Faith, I perceive our masters may throw their capsat their money: these debts may well be calleddesperate ones, for a madman owes 'em.  ","It seems our masters should probably give up on getting their money back. Now that Timon's mad, these debts are junk."
70,A-57483,"  They have e'en put my breath from me, the slaves.Creditors? devils!  ",These men have even taken my breath away. They call themselves creditors? They are devils!
71,A-49765,"  My dear lord,—  ",Timon—
72,A-69417,  What if it should be so?  ,But what if...
73,A-30900,"  My lord,—  ",Timon—
74,A-97887,  I'll have it so. My steward!  ,"Yes, that's it! Come here!"
75,A-70492,"  Here, my lord.  ",I'm here.
76,54008-1503847084057-35131," So fitly? Go, bid all my friends again, ",So soon? Go get all those men for me.

78,54009-1503847096987-12153," O my lord,  You only speak from your distracted soul; ",But my lord you only speak in a daze.
79,54009-1503847102685-9976," There is not so much left, to furnish out  A moderate table. ", You do not have enough money yet to offer even a small meal.
80,A-71000,"  Be't not in thy care; go,I charge thee, invite them all: let in the tideOf knaves once more; my cook and I'll provide.  ","Don't worry about that. Go, and invite them all. Let in that wave of villains once more. My cook and I will figure it out."
0,A-80116,"  My lord, you have my voice to it; the fault'sBloody; 'tis necessary he should die:Nothing emboldens sin so much as mercy.  ","You have my vote! He should die for this heinous act, because mercy would only lead to more behavior like it. "
1,A-66572,  Most true; the law shall bruise him.  ,I agree. He must face the rule of law.
2,A-54573,"  Honour, health, and compassion to the senate!  ",Long live the senate!
3,A-89306,"  Now, captain?  ","What, captain?"
4,54017-1503847145132-43800," I am an humble suitor to your virtues;  For pity is the virtue of the law,  And none but tyrants use it cruelly. ","I stand before you virtuous men to ask a favor. The law is a merciful thing, which only a tyrant could use for cruel purposes."
5,54017-1503847642145-25207," It pleases time and fortune to lie heavy  Upon a friend of mine, who, in hot blood,  Hath stepp'd into the law, which is past depth  To those that, without heed, do plunge into 't. "," Time and hard luck have worked against a friend of mine who recently broke the law in a fit of rage, a state which unfortunately the law does not consider when men break it."
6,54017-1503847662843-8511," He is a man, setting his fate aside,  Of comely virtues:  Nor did he soil the fact with cowardice—  An honour in him which buys out his fault—  But with a noble fury and fair spirit,  Seeing his reputation touch'd to death,  He did oppose his foe: "," My friend, this action aside, is a good man, who in the moment actually acted without cowardice—something which ought to be held against his crime—by bravely identifying and responding to one who had ruined his reputation."
7,54017-1503847671786-12904," And with such sober and unnoted passion  He did behave his anger, ere 'twas spent,  As if he had but proved an argument. "," He opposed this enemy with a clearheaded and calculating passion, expressing his anger with a certain coldness, almost as if he were proving a point."
8,54018-1503847698955-19783," You undergo too strict a paradox,  Striving to make an ugly deed look fair: ","Your argument is contradictory, a forced attempt to make gross actions seem justifiable."
9,54018-1503847826439-42400, Your words have took such pains as if they labour'd  To bring manslaughter into form and set quarrelling  Upon the head of valour; , Your rhetoric reaches almost to the point of labor as it tries to turn murder into a mere formality and feuding into an act of valor.
10,54018-1503847847482-62187, which indeed  Is valour misbegot and came into the world  When sects and factions were newly born: ," Feuds actually prove to be valor in its most degenerate form, as they come from the formation of rivalries."
11,54018-1503847868212-30280," He's truly valiant that can wisely suffer  The worst that man can breathe, and make his wrongs  His outsides, to wear them like his raiment,  carelessly, "," A man is truly valiant only when he can endure the worst insults men can speak, and even wear them like clothing without a care in the world."
12,54018-1504104458059-48367," And ne'er prefer his injuries to his heart,  To bring it into danger.  If wrongs be evils and enforce us kill,  What folly 'tis to hazard life for ill! "," True valor never takes injury to heart, or retaliates in violence. If acts of injustice are in fact evil and force us to kill others, how dumb it would be then to risk your life for such a cause!"
13,A-48303,"  My lord,—  ",But—
14,A-91923,"  You cannot make gross sins look clear:To revenge is no valour, but to bear.  ","You cannot make terrible sins look innocent. Valor is patience, not revenge."
15,54021-1503847920356-56593," My lords, then, under favour, pardon me,  If I speak like a captain.  Why do fond men expose themselves to battle,  And not endure all threats? ","Then forgive me for speaking like a military man, my lords. Why do good people fight and not patiently bear the insults of their enemies?"
16,54021-1503848726351-38158," sleep upon't,  And let the foes quietly cut their throats,  Without repugnancy? If there be  Such valour in the bearing, what make we  Abroad? why then, women are more valiant  That stay at home, "," Why do they not patiently let those same enemies murder them in their sleep? If there is such honor in patience, what do we make of our wars abroad, and why are women not considered more valiant for staying at home?"
17,54021-1503848737582-28758," if bearing carry it,  And the ass more captain than the lion, the felon  Loaden with irons wiser than the judge,  If wisdom be in suffering. "," Why do we not deem the donkey superior to the lion, or the prisoner to the judge, if there is such wisdom in suffering?"
18,54021-1503848753062-48045," O my lords,  As you are great, be pitifully good:  Who cannot condemn rashness in cold blood?  To kill, I grant, is sin's extremest gust;  But, in defence, by mercy, 'tis most just. "," You are great men, be compassionate. Who would not sentence a man for violent aggression? You are right, murder is the greatest sin, but when it is done for self-defense it is fair."
19,54021-1503848761176-51645, To be in anger is impiety;  But who is man that is not angry?  Weigh but the crime with this. ," Anger is wicked, but who has not been angry before? Think about this as you judge the crime before you."
20,A-80050,  You breathe in vain.  ,Your speech is useless.
21,A-89265,  In vain! his service doneAt Lacedaemon and ByzantiumWere a sufficient briber for his life.  ,Useless! The man's heroism at the battles of Lacedaemon and Byzantium should be enough to win him his life. 
22,A-98826,  What's that?  ,What?
23,54025-1503848773526-41442," I say, my lords, he has done fair service,  And slain in fight many of your enemies: ",The man is a hero and has killed many of our enemies.
24,54025-1503848778975-1043," How full of valour did he bear himself  In the last conflict, and made plenteous wounds! ", How bravely did he fight and wound many men in the last battle?
25,54026-1503848853129-66988," He has made too much plenty with 'em;  He's a sworn rioter: he has a sin that often  Drowns him, and takes his valour prisoner: ","He wounded too many men. He's a crazy drunk, and that vice ruins his honor."
26,54026-1503848882301-42191," If there were no foes, that were enough  To overcome him: in that beastly fury  He has been known to commit outrages,  And cherish factions: "," He would fight even if he had no enemies, and in his temper he has committed many crimes and encourages rebellion."
27,54026-1503848888809-6973," 'tis inferr'd to us,  His days are foul and his drink dangerous. ", We have been told that he is a dangerous and wicked man.
28,A-79840,  He dies.  ,He will die.
29,54028-1503920828225-48821," Hard fate! he might have died in war.  My lords, if not for any parts in him— ",How cruel! He would have died in battle if he did not have certain good qualities.
30,54028-1503920835497-15451, Though his right arm might purchase his own time  And be in debt to none ," And even though his sword-arm has bought him a longer life, in which he owes nothing to anyone, take this as encouragement to change your ruling."
31,54028-1503848935234-79978," —yet, more to move you,  Take my deserts to his, and join 'em both:  And, for I know your reverend ages love  Security, I'll pawn my victories, all  My honours to you, upon his good returns. "," Think of what's mine as his, and because I know you all love money, I'll give to you all that I have won at war in return for his safety."
32,54028-1503848948560-43883," If by this crime he owes the law his life,  Why, let the war receive 't in valiant gore  For law is strict, and war is nothing more. "," If he owes his life for this crime, let it at least be had at war with the army. War can punish the way the law does."
33,A-26637,"  We are for law: he dies; urge it no more,On height of our displeasure: friend or brother,He forfeits his own blood that spills another.  ","We represent the law. He will die, and stop pushing the point. Though it does not please us, he will die for murder, even if he is your friend or family. "
34,A-77688,"  Must it be so? it must not be. My lords,I do beseech you, know me.  ","Why does it have to be this way? It cannot be. Please, my lords, I beg you to trust me."
35,A-56033,  How!  ,How!
36,A-11246,  Call me to your remembrances.  ,Remember what I have done.
37,A-62874,  What!  ,What?
38,54034-1503848970559-97222," I cannot think but your age has forgot me;  It could not else be, ","You cannot possibly have forgotten me, but there is no other reason you would deny me"
39,54034-1503848975696-91221," I should prove so base,  To sue, and be denied such common grace:  My wounds ache at you. ", after I have lowered myself to beg for something you would grant any other man. It hurts me to the very core.
40,A-48954,"  Do you dare our anger?'Tis in few words, but spacious in effect;We banish thee for ever.  ",Are you seriously provoking us? In just a few words we can have an enormous impact. We banish you forever.
41,A-15205,"  Banish me!Banish your dotage; banish usury,That makes the senate ugly.  ",Banish me! Banish your old ways! Banish your money-lending! Banish everything that has ruined the senate!
42,54037-1503848990002-28612," If, after two days' shine, Athens contain thee,  Attend our weightier judgment. ","If we find you in Athens two days from now, you will face the most severe punishment."
43,54037-1503848996803-12095," And, not to swell  our spirit,  He shall be executed presently. "," And even though it displeases us, your friend will be executed now."
44,54039-1503849010425-46058," Now the gods keep you old enough; that you may live  Only in bone, that none may look on you!  I'm worse than mad: ","The gods have let you live so long that you are only skin and bones, and so ugly that no one will even look at you! I'm crazy with anger."
45,54039-1503849025005-79805," I have kept back their foes,  While they have told their money and let out  Their coin upon large interest, I myself  Rich only in large hurts. All those for this? "," I have defended them from their enemies. They have lent their money to everyone and pocketed the earnings, while all I have are wounds from battle. All that fighting for this?"
46,54039-1503849036763-1675, Is this the balsam that the usuring senate  Pours into captains' wounds? Banishment!  It comes not ill; I hate not to be banish'd; , Is this what the senate gives its captains for sacrificing themselves to battle? Banishment! Good! I would hate not to be banished.
47,54039-1503849055485-23443," It is a cause worthy my spleen and fury,  That I may strike at Athens. I'll cheer up  My discontented troops, and lay for hearts. ", It makes me angry enough to attack Athens. I'll gather the troops and garner their support.
48,54039-1503849060423-28607, 'Tis honour with most lands to be at odds;  Soldiers should brook as little wrongs as gods. ," Countries are always at war, and soldiers should not have to face any more trials than the gods."
0,A-43804,"  The good time of day to you, sir.  ","Good day, sir."
1,A-72085,  I also wish it to you. I think this honourable lorddid but try us this other day.  ,You too. This feels familiar.
2,A-64153,"  Upon that were my thoughts tiring, when weencountered: I hope it is not so low with him ashe made it seem in the trial of his several friends.  ",I was just thinking that when we met. I hope things are not so bad that Timon has had to borrow more from his friends.
3,A-62257,"  It should not be, by the persuasion of his new feasting.  ","From what I see at this feast, I don't think so."
4,54046-1503849107279-20332," I should think so: he hath sent me an earnest  inviting, which many my near occasions did urge me  to put off; ","I do. He sent me an invitation, and when I said I had other engagements,"
5,54046-1503849111736-11177," but he hath conjured me beyond them, and  I must needs appear. ", he pressed me further and told me I had to come.
6,54047-1503849123397-91324," In like manner was I in debt to my importunate  business, but he would not hear my excuse. ","I also said I needed to deal with some business matters, but he didn't care."
7,54047-1503849130103-39748," I am  sorry, when he sent to borrow of me, that my  provision was out. "," I am not happy to say it, but when he asked me for money, I had no more left to give him."
8,A-12589,"  I am sick of that grief too, as I understand how allthings go.  ",Same with me. I know how it is.
9,A-17687,  Every man here's so. What would he have borrowed ofyou?  ,So does everyone here. How much money did he ask you for?
10,A-19458,  A thousand pieces.  ,A thousand pieces.
11,A-63699,  A thousand pieces!  ,A thousand pieces!
12,A-31728,  What of you?  ,What did he ask you for?
13,A-81979,"  He sent to me, sir,—Here he comes.  ",He asked me for—here he is.
14,A-45124,"  With all my heart, gentlemen both; and how fare you?  ","Greetings, gentleman. How are you?"
15,A-87258,"  Ever at the best, hearing well of your lordship.  ","Well, especially after seeing that you are well, too."
16,A-94750,  The swallow follows not summer more willing than weyour lordship.  ,We care as much about you as a bird that flies south cares for summer weather.
17,54058-1503849177700-88415, Nor more willingly leaves winter; such  summer-birds are men. , And you and other men have left me with the readiness that the bird flees from winter weather.
18,54058-1503849190244-30442," Gentlemen, our dinner will not  recompense this long stay: feast your ears with the  music awhile, if they will fare so harshly o' the  trumpet's sound; we shall to 't presently. "," Dinner is getting cold, gentlemen! Enjoy the music, if you like such humble playing. Let's go."
19,A-18456,  I hope it remains not unkindly with your lordshipthat I returned you an empty messenger.  ,I hope you are not bitter that I could not lend you money.
20,A-98893,"  O, sir, let it not trouble you.  ",Don't worry about it.
21,A-60514,"  My noble lord,—  ",My noble lord—
22,A-98312,"  Ah, my good friend, what cheer?  ",What a party!
23,A-36916,"  My most honourable lord, I am e'en sick of shame,that, when your lordship this other day sent to me,I was so unfortunate a beggar.  ","Timon, I feel so bad that I had no money left to give you when you asked me."
24,A-37890,"  Think not on 't, sir.  ",Don't worry about it.
25,A-57600,"  If you had sent but two hours before,—  ",If you had come just two hours earlier—
26,A-63841,  Let it not cumber your better remembrance.  ,Think about happier things.
27,A-22171,"  Come, bring in all together.  ","Come here, the food is ready!"
28,A-33846,  All covered dishes!  ,It must be good food if you cover it this way!
29,A-53738,"  Royal cheer, I warrant you.  ",It looks like food for kings.
30,A-20245,"  Doubt not that, if money and the season can yieldit.  ","As long as he has enough money and time, I would count on it from Timon."
31,A-15926,  How do you? What's the news?  ,Oh how are you? What is new with the world?
32,A-45268,  Alcibiades is banished: hear you of it?  ,Did you hear that Alcibiades is banished?
33,A-91232,  Alcibiades banished!  ,What? Alcibiades is banished?
34,A-92177,"  'Tis so, be sure of it.  ",I swear.
35,A-48247,  How! how!  ,What? How?
36,A-78657,"  I pray you, upon what?  ",Why?
37,A-69336,"  My worthy friends, will you draw near?  ","Come here, my friends."
38,A-74271,  I'll tell you more anon. Here's a noble feast toward.  ,I'll tell you about it later. Let's eat now.
39,A-94715,  This is the old man still.  ,You speak of the famous Alcibiades?
40,A-79509,  Will 't hold? will 't hold?  ,Can it be? Will the punishment stick?
41,A-36746,  It does: but time will—and so—  ,"Yes, but time will tell—"
42,A-53948,  I do conceive.  ,I see.
43,54084-1503849313156-12764," Each man to his stool, with that spur as he would to  the lip of his mistress: your diet shall be in all  places alike.  Make not a city feast of it, to let  the meat cool ere we can agree upon the first place: ","Go to your chairs as hungrily as you might kiss the lips of your mistress. There are no assigned seats, when the food gets cold before people find out where they sit."
44,54084-1503849330463-45874," sit, sit. The gods require our thanks.  You great benefactors, sprinkle our society with  thankfulness. For your own gifts, make yourselves  praised: but reserve still to give, lest your  deities be despised. "," Sit, sit, and thank the gods. I thank you for the gifts you have given, and hope you will keep enough for yourselves so that you can still be so charitable in the future."
45,54084-1503849340041-87068," Lend to each man enough, that  one need not lend to another; for, were your  godheads to borrow of men, men would forsake the  gods. "," You should have given enough that no man will have to give his own money to another, because even gods would not be successful in applying for a loan nowadays."
46,54084-1503849413973-27612," Make the meat be beloved more than the man  that gives it. Let no assembly of twenty be without  a score of villains: if there sit twelve women at  the table, let a dozen of them be—as they are. "," Enjoy the meat more than you enjoy the man who provides you with it. Make sure also that twenty out of twenty men are villains, as you might let twelve women at a table be as they are."
47,54084-1503849424544-56430," The  rest of your fees, O gods—the senators of Athens,  together with the common lag of people—what is  amiss in them, you gods, make suitable for  destruction. "," As for the rest, the senators and the commoners, destroy the worst parts of them."
48,54084-1503849430685-24060," For these my present friends, as they  are to me nothing, so in nothing bless them, and to  nothing are they welcome.  Uncover, dogs, and lap. "," My friends here, they mean nothing to me, so bless them with nothing. Here they are welcome to nothing. Uncover the dishes so the dogs may lick up the water."
49,A-61517,  What does his lordship mean?  ,What is this supposed to mean?
50,A-42334,  I know not.  ,I don't know.
51,54088-1503849443502-29568," May you a better feast never behold,  You knot of mouth-friends I smoke and lukewarm water  Is your perfection. ","All you bottom-feeders, water and steam is the perfect meal for you, and I hope you never eat a better feast than this for the rest of your lives."
52,54088-1503849453131-40678," This is Timon's last;  Who, stuck and spangled with your flatteries,  Washes it off, and sprinkles in your faces  Your reeking villany. "," I, who endured all your flattery, wash myself of it and return to you your wickedness."
53,54090-1503849815522-48961," Live loathed and long,  Most smiling, smooth, detested parasites,  Courteous destroyers, affable wolves, meek bears,  You fools of fortune, trencher-friends, time's flies,  Cap and knee slaves, vapours, and minute-jacks! ","I hope you live long and painful lives, you smooth-talking parasites, you wolves in sheeps' clothing, you weak fools of fortune, fake friends, worthless workers!"
54,54090-1503849824121-19430," Of man and beast the infinite malady  Crust you quite o'er! What, dost thou go? ","You'll die soon enough! May the worst disease cover you all over in scabs! What, are you leaving?"
55,54090-1503849829979-51450," Soft! take thy physic first—thou too—and thou;—  Stay, I will lend thee money, borrow none. "," Come now, everyone, take your medicine first! Come on, I'll give you money and ask for nothing back!"
56,54092-1503849840633-91373," What, all in motion? Henceforth be no feast,  Whereat a villain's not a welcome guest. ","What, everyone's leaving? From now on, let there never be a feast where such villains are not welcome."

","He's a madman, and his insanity is what drives him. He gave me a jewel the other day, and now he has beaten it out of my hat. Have you seen the jewel?"
63,A-22343,  Did you see my cap?  ,Have you seen my hat?
64,A-69529,  Here 'tis.  ,Here it is.
65,A-98596,  Here lies my gown.  ,And here's my coat.
66,A-61784,  Let's make no stay.  ,Let's get out of here.
67,A-69476,  Lord Timon's mad.  ,Timon is crazy.
68,A-31847,  I feel 't upon my bones.  ,Yes I am sure of it.
69,A-85868,"  One day he gives us diamonds, next day stones.  ","One day he gives us diamonds, and the next day he throws stones at us!"
0,54109-1503868352123-99911," Let me look back upon thee. O thou wall,  That girdlest in those wolves, dive in the earth,  And fence not Athens! ","Let me back on the city. Your walls that contain those ravenous wolves should sink into the earth instead of protecting you, Athens."

Obedience fail in children! slaves and fools,  Pluck the grave wrinkled senate from the bench, "," I hope your mothers become drunks and that your children grow bad-tempered!

31,57540-1499715546627-78247," Verily!  You put me off with limber vows; but I,  Though you would seek t'unsphere the  stars with oaths,  Should yet say 'Sir, no going.' ","""Truly!"" You can keep putting me off with promises, but even if you swore by all the stars in the sky, I'd still say, ""Sir, you're staying."" "
32,57540-1499715568538-8099," Verily,  You shall not go. A lady's 'Verily' is  As potent as a lord's. Will you go yet? ","Truly, you can't leave—a woman's ""truly"" is as strong as a man's. Are you still intent on leaving? "

35,A-79430,"  Your guest, then, madam:To be your prisoner should import offending;Which is for me less easy to commitThan you to punish.  ","I'll be your guest, then. For me to be your prisoner would imply that I'd committed some crime against you. It'd be harder for me to do that than it would be for you to punish me."
36,A-91089,"  Not your gaoler, then,But your kind hostess. Come, I'll question youOf my lord's tricks and yours when you were boys:You were pretty lordings then?  ","Then I'm not your jailer; I'm your kind hostess. Come on, I'll ask you all about your and my husband's shenanigans back when you were kids. You were cute little kings-to-be back then, weren't you?"
37,A-60732,"  We were, fair queen,Two lads that thought there was no more behindBut such a day to-morrow as to-day,And to be boy eternal.  ","We were two kids who lived like there was no tomorrow, and thought we'd be boys forever."
38,A-76895,  Was not my lordThe verier wag o' the two?  ,And wasn't my husband the bigger troublemaker out of you two?
39,57545-1499715646843-74207," We were as twinn'd lambs that did frisk i' the sun,  And bleat the one at the other: ",We were like two lambs that frolicked in the sunshine and bleated to each other; 
40,57545-1499715668629-4042," what we changed  Was innocence for innocence; we knew not  The doctrine of ill-doing, nor dream'd  That any did. ",we were completely innocent and knew nothing about evil. We couldn't even comprehend evil. 
41,57545-1499715685246-6129," Had we pursued that life,  And our weak spirits ne'er been higher rear'd  With stronger blood, we should have answer'd heaven  Boldly 'not guilty;' the imposition clear'd  Hereditary ours. ","If we'd stayed like that, and we'd never had to grow up, we could have gone to heaven and honestly told God that we'd never sinned."
42,A-44758,  By this we gatherYou have tripp'd since.  ,Should we take that to mean that you've slipped up since then?
43,57547-1499715780120-67459, O my most sacred lady! ,"Oh, you virtuous woman! "
44,57547-1499715794138-59290, Temptations have since then been born to's; for  In those unfledged days was my wife a girl; ,"We have definitely come across temptation since then. But back in those days, my wife was still a young girl, "
45,57547-1499715803442-36903, Your precious self had then not cross'd the eyes  Of my young play-fellow. ,and you hadn't yet caught my young playmate's eye.
46,57548-1499715815193-73657, Grace to boot! ,And wasn't that lucky! 
47,57548-1499715858235-38548," Of this make no conclusion, lest you say  Your queen and I are devils: ","Please, don't finish your story. Next you're going to say that your queen and I are devils. "
48,57548-1499715885989-96484," yet go on;  The offences we have made you do we'll answer,  If you first sinn'd with us and that with us  You did continue fault and that you slipp'd not  With any but with us. ","Actually, keep going—we'll admit to being the cause of your sin as long as you admit you sinned with us for the first time and swear you haven't sinned with anyone else since."
49,A-71665,  Is he won yet?  ,Have you convinced him yet?
50,A-95310,  He'll stay my lord.  ,"He'll stay, sweetheart."
51,A-97679,"  At my request he would not.Hermione, my dearest, thou never spokestTo better purpose.  ","He wouldn't when I asked! Hermione, you've never spoken better."
52,A-31942,  Never?  ,Never?
53,A-18753,"  Never, but once.  ","Never, except once."
54,57554-1499715924884-1822, What! have I twice said well? when was't before? ,What? Have I said the right thing twice? When was the first time? 
55,57554-1499716269772-9372," I prithee tell me; cram's with praise, and make's  As fat as tame things: ",Please tell me. Butter me up with praise 'til I'm as fat as a pig for the slaughter. 
56,57554-1499716289641-24801, one good deed dying tongueless  Slaughters a thousand waiting upon that. ,"If you don't compliment a good deed, you'll stop that person from doing a thousand more good things that person might have done."
57,57554-1499716049849-65585, Our praises are our wages: , Your compliments are my reward. 
58,57554-1499716314604-76951, you may ride's  With one soft kiss a thousand furlongs ere  With spur we beat an acre.  But to the goal:  My last good deed was to entreat his stay:  What was my first? ,"For a single kiss, you can ride me for a mile before you'd have to kick me with your spurs. Back to the point: if my most recent accomplishment was convincing him to stay, what was the first one? "
59,57554-1499716336478-14229," it has an elder sister,  Or I mistake you: O, would her name were Grace! ","This accomplishment must have a sister, unless I misunderstood you. If only her name were ""Grace!"" "
60,57554-1499716347973-89841," But once before I spoke to the purpose: when?  Nay, let me have't; I long. ",There was another time I said something good? What was it? Please tell me; I'm dying to know.
61,57555-1499716398675-50139," Why, that was when  Three crabbed months had sour'd themselves to death,  Ere I could make thee open thy white hand  And clap thyself my love: ","Obviously that was when, after three long, bitter months, I convinced you to give me your hand in marriage. "
62,57555-1499716405772-57585, then didst thou utter  'I am yours for ever.' ,"At that moment, you said, ""I am yours forever."""
63,A-68515,"  'Tis grace indeed.Why, lo you now, I have spoke to the purpose twice:The one for ever earn'd a royal husband;The other for some while a friend.  ","That was definitely ""grace,"" wasn't it? Well, look at that, I've said the right thing two whole times. The first time, I earned a royal husband forever; the second time, I earned a friend for a while."
64,57557-1499796682129-30223,"  Too hot, too hot!  To mingle friendship far is mingling bloods. "," Too far, too far! Friendships that get too close always end with the ""friends"" having sex. "
65,57557-1499716551145-8813," I have  tremor cordis  on me: my heart dances;  But not for joy; not joy. This entertainment  May a free face put on, derive a liberty  From heartiness, from bounty, fertile bosom,  And well become the agent; 't may, I grant; ","I'm having a heart attack. My heart is racing, but not with excitement—definitely not. They might as well be relaxed and open with each other here at the party, and blame it on the plentiful food and drink. "
66,57557-1499716578061-84675," But to be paddling palms and pinching fingers,  As now they are, and making practised smiles,  As in a looking-glass, and then to sigh, as 'twere  The mort o' the deer; ","But holding hands and linking fingers, and smiling stupidly at each other and sighing as if they were having an orgasm—"
67,57557-1499716603501-16447," O, that is entertainment  My bosom likes not, nor my brows! ","that kind of ""party"" hurts my heart and my head."
68,57557-1499716611341-33911," Mamillius,  Art thou my boy? ","Mamillius, are you my son?"
69,A-82522,"  Ay, my good lord.  ","Yes, sir."
70,57559-1499716637128-81769," I' fecks!  Why, that's my bawcock. What, hast  smutch'd thy nose? ",Goodness gracious! There's my little chickadee. Is that some dirt on your nose? 
71,57559-1499716674859-71719," They say it is a copy out of mine. Come, captain,  We must be neat; not neat, but cleanly, captain: ","They say it looks just like mine. Come on, buddy, we should be part of the same herd. "
72,57559-1499716686495-72380," And yet the steer, the heifer and the calf  Are all call'd neat.— ","Did you know that a bull, a cow, and a calf are called a herd?"
73,57559-1499716697497-20831, Still virginalling  Upon his palm!— ,Still holding his hand! 
74,57559-1499716711642-9238," How now, you wanton calf!  Art thou my calf? "," Well, my silly little calf. Are you my calf?"
75,A-69692,"  Yes, if you will, my lord.  ","Yes, of course, sir."
76,57561-1499716748178-24737," Thou want'st a rough pash and the shoots that I have,  To be full like me: yet they say we are  Almost as like as eggs; women say so, ","You'll need a beard and some horns if you want to be just like me! They say we're two peas in a pod—well, women say so, "
77,57561-1499716784145-92946," That will say anything but were they false  As o'er-dyed blacks, as wind, as waters, false  As dice are to be wish'd by one that fixes  No bourn 'twixt his and mine, yet were it true  To say this boy were like me. ","and they'd say anything. Women are as fake as dyed-blonde hair, as stable as wind, as solid as water, as fair as loaded dice—and yet, it's true that this boy looks like me. "
78,57561-1499716824723-21958," Come, sir page,  Look on me with your welkin eye: sweet villain!  Most dear'st! my collop! Can thy dam?—may't be?— ","Come here, buddy, look at me with your dreamy eyes! You precious thing! My dear! My son! Could your mother—can it be? "
79,57561-1499716847978-58379," Affection! thy intention stabs the centre:  Thou dost make possible things not so held,  Communicatest with dreams;—how can this be?— ","I'm going crazy! Madness is making me think this, making me believe impossible things, making nightmares a reality. How can this be? "
80,57561-1499716871740-2950," With what's unreal thou coactive art,  And fellow'st nothing: then 'tis very credent  Thou mayst co-join with something; and thou dost,  And that beyond commission, and I find it,  And that to the infection of my brains  And hardening of my brows. ","Madness and unreality together make nothing, so it makes sense that it would hook up with something, and it does, beyond compare, and I'm there already—so much so that my brain is sick and horns are sprouting out of my head!"
81,A-44807,  What means Sicilia?  ,Is Leontes all right?
82,A-49941,  He something seems unsettled.  ,He seems a little upset.
83,A-80181,"  How, my lord!What cheer? how is't with you, best brother?  ","Hey, are you all right? How are you, brother?"
84,A-57286,"  You look as if you held a brow of much distractionAre you moved, my lord?  ","Your forehead looks wrinkled with thought. Are you upset, my love?"
85,57566-1499716913308-21128," No, in good earnest. ","No, really, I'm fine."
86,57566-1499716940757-15854," How sometimes nature will betray its folly,  Its tenderness, and make itself a pastime  To harder bosoms! "," See how our bodies give us away, giving other people a chance to laugh at us! "
87,57566-1499716977432-92681," Looking on the lines  Of my boy's face, methoughts I did recoil  Twenty-three years, and saw myself unbreech'd,  In my green velvet coat, my dagger muzzled,  Lest it should bite its master, and so prove,  As ornaments oft do, too dangerous: ","Just now, looking at my son's face, I went back in time twenty-three years and saw myself back before I wore pants, in my green velvet coat, with a blunt practice sword (it was blunt so that I didn't cut myself, since that kind of toy is dangerous when you're a kid). "
88,57566-1499717007987-75799," How like, methought, I then was to this kernel,  This squash, this gentleman. ",Back then I was so much like this kid. 
89,57566-1499717016383-26623," Mine honest friend,  Will you take eggs for money? ","Buddy, would you let yourself be robbed?"
90,A-26010,"  No, my lord, I'll fight.  ","No, sir, I'll fight."
91,A-30649,"  You will! why, happy man be's dole! My brother,Are you so fond of your young prince as weDo seem to be of ours?  ","You will? Well, lucky me!  Brother, do you love your son as much as I seem to love mine?"
92,57569-1499717046197-96387," If at home, sir,  He's all my exercise, my mirth, my matter,  Now my sworn friend and then mine enemy,  My parasite, my soldier, statesman, all: ","When I'm at home I spend all my time playing, laughing, and working with him. He's my friend and my enemy, my shadow, my soldier, my little king-in-training. "

","Sir, I'll tell you, since you're bringing honor into this. Listen closely and do exactly what I say as soon as I say it, otherwise you and I are both done for!"
196,A-27709,"  On, good Camillo.  ","Go on, Camillo."
197,A-50707,  I am appointed him to murder you.  ,He ordered me to murder you.
198,A-88390,"  By whom, Camillo?  ","Who ordered you, Camillo?"
199,A-96345,  By the king.  ,The king.
200,A-30994,  For what?  ,Why?

","He thinks—actually, he swears as confidently as if he saw you do it or told you to do it himself—that you're having a secret affair with Hermione."

203,57638-1499718984539-49617," Turn then my freshest reputation to  A savour that may strike the dullest nostril  Where I arrive, ","My reputation is ruined. From now on, I'll stink of this. I'll walk into a room and everyone will complain about the stench. "
204,57638-1499718995428-54852," and my approach be shunn'd,  Nay, hated too, worse than the great'st infection  That e'er was heard or read! ",I'll be shunned and hated more than the worst epidemic in the history of the world.

207,A-21486,  How should this grow?  ,How did this happen?
208,57641-1499719099339-57947, I know not: but I am sure 'tis safer to  Avoid what's grown than question how 'tis born. ,"I don't know, but it's probably safer to get out of the way than it is to stand around and debate about how it got started. "
209,57641-1499719122660-50922," If therefore you dare trust my honesty,  That lies enclosed in this trunk which you  Shall bear along impawn'd, away to-night!  Your followers I will whisper to the business,  And will by twos and threes at several posterns  Clear them o' the city. ","If you trust me, pack your things and leave tonight. I'll whisper the plan to your servants and we'll leave the city in groups of two or three, all by different gates. "
210,57641-1499719157545-3256," For myself, I'll put  My fortunes to your service, which are here  By this discovery lost. Be not uncertain;  For, by the honour of my parents, I  Have utter'd truth: ","From this point on, I offer my services to you, considering I'll be dead if I'm found here after you're gone. I swear on my parents' lives that everything I've told you is true. "
211,57641-1499719166225-45992," which if you seek to prove,  I dare not stand by; nor shall you be safer  Than one condemn'd by the king's own mouth, thereon  His execution sworn. ","If you want to test it on Leontes, you better believe I won't stick around—you'll be as condemned to die as a criminal sitting on death row."
212,57642-1499719182425-8147, I do believe thee:  I saw his heart in 's face. Give me thy hand: ,I believe you; the look on his face said it all. Give me your hand:

My ships are ready and  My people did expect my hence departure  Two days ago. ,"if you lead me out of here, you can continue to work for me as my servant. My ships are ready and my people are, too, because they had expected to leave two days ago. "
214,57642-1499719215691-38232," This jealousy  Is for a precious creature: as she's rare,  Must it be great, and as his person's mighty,  Must it be violent, and as he does conceive  He is dishonour'd by a man which ever  Profess'd to him, why, his revenges must  In that be made more bitter. ","Leontes is jealous of a very special woman and, because she's so special, his jealousy is intense; because he's a powerful king, his jealousy will be violent, too, and because he thinks he's been betrayed by his best friend, his revenge will be horrific. "

","I'm paralyzed with fear. Let's hope we have a safe journey out and that the queen doesn't become a victim, too, of his delusions. "

2,A-60062,"  No, I'll none of you.  ","No, I don't want you."
3,A-51327,"  Why, my sweet lord?  ","Why not, little man?"
4,A-11786,  You'll kiss me hard and speak to me as ifI were a baby still. I love you better.  ,You'll kiss me too hard and talk to me like I'm still a baby.  I love you better.
5,A-40067,"  And why so, my lord?  ","And why's that, sir?"
6,A-43366,"  Not for becauseYour brows are blacker; yet black brows, they say,Become some women best, so that there be notToo much hair there, but in a semicircleOr a half-moon made with a pen.  ","Not because your eyebrows are dark, although they say dark eyebrows look good on some women. It's better if you pluck them in a semi-circle, or draw a half-moon shape with a pen."
7,A-72721,  Who taught you this?  ,Who taught you this?
8,A-76916,  I learnt it out of women's faces. Pray nowWhat colour are your eyebrows?  ,I learned it from women's faces. I have a question: what color are your eyebrows?
9,A-15412,"  Blue, my lord.  ","Blue, sir."
10,A-37112,"  Nay, that's a mock: I have seen a lady's noseThat has been blue, but not her eyebrows.  ","No, you're joking. I've seen a lady's nose that was blue, but never her eyebrows."
11,A-26669,"  Hark ye;The queen your mother rounds apace: we shallPresent our services to a fine new princeOne of these days; and then you'ld wanton with us,If we would have you.  ","Listen, your mother is coming over. Pretty soon we'll have a new prince to take care of, and then you'll wish we'd play with you more."
12,A-16535,  She is spread of lateInto a goodly bulk: good time encounter her!  ,She's looking really pregnant all of a sudden. She'll go into labor soon!
13,A-49098,"  What wisdom stirs amongst you? Come, sir, nowI am for you again: pray you, sit by us,And tell 's a tale.  ","What are you all talking about?  Come here, Mamillius, I'm ready to deal with you again. Come on, come sit by me and tell me a story."
14,A-69920,  Merry or sad shall't be?  ,"A happy story, or a sad story?"
15,A-52893,  As merry as you will.  ,As happy as you want it to be.
16,A-12991,  A sad tale's best for winter: I have oneOf sprites and goblins.  ,A sad story's best for winter. I know one about ghosts and goblins.
17,A-84481,"  Let's have that, good sir.Come on, sit down: come on, and do your bestTo fright me with your sprites; you're powerful at it.  ","Let's hear it, then. Come on, sit down, come on. And do your best to scare me with your ghosts—you're very good at that."
18,A-44202,  There was a man—  ,"""There was a man—"
19,A-17497,"  Nay, come, sit down; then on.  ","No, come and sit down. Now go on."
20,A-27338,  Dwelt by a churchyard: I will tell it softly;Yond crickets shall not hear it.  ,"—who lived by a church."" I'll whisper it so quietly that the crickets out there won't be able to hear it."
21,A-37264,"  Come on, then,And give't me in mine ear.  ","Come on, then, and whisper it in my ear."
22,A-39928,  Was he met there? his train? Camillo with him?  ,Did you find him? His servants? Was Camillo with him?
23,A-72027,  Behind the tuft of pines I met them; neverSaw I men scour so on their way: I eyed themEven to their ships.  ,I saw them while I was hiding behind a cluster of pine trees. I never saw men hurry away so quickly. I watched them go all the way to their ships.
24,57671-1499719310980-15714," How blest am I  In my just censure, in my true opinion!  Alack, for lesser knowledge! how accursed  In being so blest! ",I am so blessed—I knew it; I was right. If only I knew less! This blessing is a curse! 
25,57671-1499719328568-73382," There may be in the cup  A spider steep'd, and one may drink, depart,  And yet partake no venom, for his knowledge  Is not infected: ","If someone has a cup with a poisonous spider hiding in it, he can drink and not be poisoned because his knowledge isn't infected. "
26,57671-1499719339222-35014," but if one present  The abhorr'd ingredient to his eye, make known  How he hath drunk, he cracks his gorge, his sides,  With violent hefts. I have drunk,  and seen the spider. ","But if you pull the spider out of the cup, show it to him, and explain that he just drank poison, he'll start vomiting. I have drunk, and seen the spider. "
27,57671-1499719361545-48469," Camillo was his help in this, his pander:  There is a plot against my life, my crown;  All's true that is mistrusted: that false villain  Whom I employ'd was pre-employ'd by him: ",Camillo was his accomplice; they're planning to kill me and take over my throne. Everything I suspected turned out to be true. That dirty liar—who worked for me— was a double agent working for Polixenes. 
28,57671-1499719371388-6652," He has discover'd my design, and I  Remain a pinch'd thing; yea, a very trick  For them to play at will. ","He figured out what I knew, but I'm still in their clutches and they're still playing me for a fool."
29,57671-1499719380276-54133, How came the posterns  So easily open? , How were they able to open the gates?
30,A-96769,  By his great authority;Which often hath no less prevail'd than soOn your command.  ,Camillo had the power to open them—he's done it many times at your command.
31,A-68759,"  I know't too well.Give me the boy: I am glad you did not nurse him:Though he does bear some signs of me, yet youHave too much blood in him.  ","Ah, I knew that. Give me the boy. I'm glad you didn't breastfeed him. Even though he looks kind of like me, you have too many of your genes in him already."
32,A-42137,  What is this? sport?  ,Is this a joke?
33,A-56667,  Bear the boy hence; he shall not come about her;Away with him! and let her sport herselfWith that she's big with; for 'tis PolixenesHas made thee swell thus.  ,I know it was Polixenes that got you pregnant.
34,A-23876,"  But I'ld say he had not,And I'll be sworn you would believe my saying,Howe'er you lean to the nayward.  ","But I say it wasn't him, and I am sure you will believe me, even if you were inclined to think otherwise ."
35,57677-1499719408770-70424," You, my lords,  Look on her, mark her well; be but about  To say 'she is a goodly lady,' and  The justice of your hearts will thereto add  'Tis pity she's not honest, honourable:' ","All right, men, take a good look at her. I know what you're thinking: ""She's an attractive woman, but it's too bad that she's a liar and a cheater."" "
36,57677-1499719447823-52511," Praise her but for this her without-door form,  Which on my faith deserves high speech, and straight  The shrug, the hum or ha, these petty brands  That calumny doth use—O, I am out—  That mercy does, for calumny will sear  Virtue itself: ","You can compliment her outer beauty, sure—I mean, she deserves that! But then you have to admit that liars use their good looks to manipulate others into thinking they're good people! "
37,57677-1499719457397-75396," these shrugs, these hums and ha's,  When you have said 'she's goodly,' come between  Ere you can say 'she's honest:' but be 't known,  From him that has most cause to grieve it should be,  She's an adulteress. ","Your shrugs and your ""hmms"" show you're hesitant to say ""she's honest,"" right? Everybody believe me; I'm the the real victim. She's having an affair."
38,A-34575,"  Should a villain say so,The most replenish'd villain in the world,He were as much more villain: you, my lord,Do but mistake.  ","If the worst villain in the world said that, he'd be twice as evil just for saying so. But you—you've only made a mistake."
39,57679-1499719476062-99347," You have mistook, my lady,  Polixenes for Leontes: O thou thing! ","You've made the mistake, sweetheart: mistaking Polixenes for Leontes. You monster! "
40,57679-1499719493539-65086," Which I'll not call a creature of thy place,  Lest barbarism, making me the precedent,  Should a like language use to all degrees  And mannerly distinguishment leave out  Betwixt the prince and beggar: ","I can't call you a queen anymore, because if I did, the word ""queen"" would cease to mean anything. You might as well call a beggar a queen. "
41,57679-1499719521473-69358," I have said  She's an adulteress; I have said with whom:  More, she's a traitor and Camillo is  A federary with her, "," I've said it: she's having an affair, and I said with whom. On top of that, she's a traitor and Camillo is in cahoots with her. "
42,57679-1499719534266-32485," and one that knows  What she should shame to know herself  But with her most vile principal, that she's  A bed-swerver, even as bad as those  That vulgars give bold'st titles, ay, and privy  To this their late escape. ",He knew all about the dirty deeds she and Polixenes got up to. He knew she was a whore and he knew all about their plan to escape.
43,57680-1499719559697-36905," No, by my life.  Privy to none of this. ",No; I swear on my life. There was nothing to know. 
44,57680-1499719568161-73035," How will this grieve you,  When you shall come to clearer knowledge, that  You thus have publish'd me! ",You'll regret this when you come to your senses—you'll regret the things you've said about me!
45,57680-1499719575206-33750," Gentle my lord,  You scarce can right me throughly then to say  You did mistake. ","Sweetheart, you can almost totally fix this now if you admit you made a mistake."
46,A-19301,"  No; if I mistakeIn those foundations which I build upon,The centre is not big enough to bearA school-boy's top. Away with her! to prison!He who shall speak for her is afar off guiltyBut that he speaks.  ","No. If the foundation of everything I believe turns out to be fake, the whole thing will collapse.  Take her away to the prison! Anyone who tries to defend her is guilty, too."
47,57682-1499719601460-5967, There's some ill planet reigns:  I must be patient till the heavens look  With an aspect more favourable. ,There's some kind of evil in the air. I'll have to be patient until this all clears up. 
48,57682-1499719612519-72036," Good my lords,  I am not prone to weeping, as our sex  Commonly are; the want of which vain dew  Perchance shall dry your pities: ","Listen, everyone: unlike most women, I'm not one to cry, and the fact that I'm not shedding a tear might lead you not to pity me. "
49,57682-1499719625448-55737, but I have  That honourable grief lodged here which burns  Worse than tears drown: ,But I promise you that my heart is hurting more right now than tears could show. 
50,57682-1499719634375-47708," beseech you all, my lords,  With thoughts so qualified as your charities  Shall best instruct you, measure me; and so  The king's will be perform'd! ","I'm begging you, all of you, to think clearly, see me clearly, and help the king to do the right thing!"
51,A-28395,  Shall I be heard?  ,Is anyone listening to me?
52,57684-1499719652545-69437," Who is't that goes with me? Beseech your highness,  My women may be with me; for you see  My plight requires it. ","Who's coming with me? Begging your pardon, Leontes, but I need some women to come with me on account of the pregnancy. "
53,57684-1499719689689-5846," Do not weep, good fools;  There is no cause: when you shall know your mistress  Has deserved prison, then abound in tears  As I come out: this action I now go on  Is for my better grace. ", Don't cry; there's no reason to cry. You can cry if and when you find out that I actually deserve to be in prison. What's happening here is only a chance for me to demonstrate grace. 
54,57684-1499719700464-17152," Adieu, my lord:  I never wish'd to see you sorry; now  I trust I shall. "," Goodbye, sir. I never hoped to see you regret something; now I'm sure I will."
55,57684-1499719711882-89805," My women, come; you have leave. "," Ladies, come on, you have permission."
56,A-63147,"  Go, do our bidding; hence!  ","Go, do what I say! Get out!"
57,A-17285,"  Beseech your highness, call the queen again.  ","Please, sir, tell the queen to come back."
58,A-32523,"  Be certain what you do, sir, lest your justiceProve violence; in the which three great ones suffer,Yourself, your queen, your son.  ","You'd better be sure of what you're doing, sir, or what you think is ""justice"" will devolve into violence that only causes you, your queen, and your son to suffer."
59,A-49896,"  For her, my lord,I dare my life lay down and will do't, sir,Please you to accept it, that the queen is spotlessI' the eyes of heaven and to you; I mean,In this which you accuse her.  ","Sir, I swear on my life that the queen is innocent; I'd even die to defend it if you'd accept my sacrifice. I mean, she's innocent of what you've accused her."
60,57690-1499719759333-63608," If it prove  She's otherwise, I'll keep my stables where  I lodge my wife; ","If it turns out otherwise, I'll make my wife sleep in the stable. "
61,57690-1499719784135-86837, I'll go in couples with her;  Than when I feel and see her no farther trust her; ,I'll rig her to my carriage and won't trust her any farther than I can throw her. 
62,57690-1499719792737-95292," For every inch of woman in the world,  Ay, every dram of woman's flesh is false, If she be. ","I mean, if Hermione's a cheater, then every atom of every woman in the world is, too."
63,A-49772,  Hold your peaces.  ,Everyone shut up.
64,A-87146,"  Good my lord,—  ",Sir—
65,57693-1499719816739-72170," It is for you we speak, not for ourselves:  You are abused and by some putter-on  That will be damn'd for't; would I knew the villain,  I would land-damn him. ","We're speaking for your sake, not ours. You've clearly been manipulated by some crook, and we'll punish him for it. I wish I knew the guy; I would ruin his life. "
66,57693-1499719837120-41402," Be she honour-flaw'd,  I have three daughters; the eldest is eleven  The second and the third, nine, and some five;  If this prove true, they'll pay for't: ","If Hermione's corrupt . . . I have three daughters. The oldest is eleven, the younger two are nine and five. If this turns out to be true, they'll pay for it. "
67,57693-1499719852145-38662," by mine honour,  I'll geld 'em all; fourteen they shall not see,  To bring false generations: they are co-heirs; ","I swear I'll neuter all of them. They'll never hit puberty and they'll never give birth to their own bastard children. Keep in mind, they're supposed to inherit my money and everything equally. "
68,57693-1499719859142-23261, And I had rather glib myself than they  Should not produce fair issue. ,I'd rather castrate myself than see them unable to have their own families.
69,A-33149,  Cease; no more.You smell this business with a sense as coldAs is a dead man's nose: but I do see't and feel'tAs you feel doing thus; and see withalThe instruments that feel.  ,"Stop, no more. You're onto the scent about as much as a dead man's nose. But I do see how emotional you are, and I feel for you. I still have the capacity to feel."
70,A-37246,"  If it be so,We need no grave to bury honesty:There's not a grain of it the face to sweetenOf the whole dungy earth.  ","If that's true, then we shouldn't have to do away with truth altogether. Right now it's like truth has disappeared from the face of the earth."
71,A-72065,  What! lack I credit?  ,"What, you don't believe me?"
72,A-45310,"  I had rather you did lack than I, my lord,Upon this ground; and more it would content meTo have her honour true than your suspicion,Be blamed for't how you might.  ","I'd prefer not to believe you, sir, on this issue. I'd rather see Hermione defended, no matter how you might be blamed for starting things."
73,57698-1499719883276-86538," Why, what need we  Commune with you of this, but rather follow  Our forceful instigation? ","Well, what do I need you guys for? I can carry out the investigation myself. "
74,57698-1499719899529-67613," Our prerogative  Calls not your counsels, but our natural goodness  Imparts this; ",I don't ask your opinions because I want them; I ask because I'm a generous guy.

","If your girlfriend interpreted this as a lack of love on your part, you'd be hard-pressed to convince her that you really care."

I told you what would come of this: beseech you,  Of your own state take care: this dream of mine,—  Being now awake, I'll queen it no inch farther,  But milk my ewes and weep. "," Will you go, then? I told you what would come of this. Please, remember that you are a prince. It was all a dream. Now I'm awake, and I won't imagine I'm a queen anymore. I'll just go back to my sheep and cry."
215,A-90166,"  Why, how now, father!Speak ere thou diest.  ","What do you say for yourself, shepherd? Speak or you die."

225,58105-1499788975964-51548," at this time  He will allow no speech, which I do guess  You do not purpose to him; and as hardly  Will he endure your sight as yet, I fear: ","He doesn't want to hear from you right now, so I don't suggest you try it. He probably doesn't want to see you, either. "
226,58105-1499788986405-92171," Then, till the fury of his highness settle,  Come not before him. ",Stay away from him until his anger dies down.

228,A-97835,"  Even he, my lord.  ","That's me, sir."

231,58109-1499789018966-37958," Lift up thy looks:  From my succession wipe me, father; I  Am heir to my affection. ",Chin up! My father can disown me; I have my love to sustain me.
232,A-72626,  Be advised.  ,You should think this through . . .

234,A-18848,"  This is desperate, sir.  ","This is irresponsible, sir."
235,58113-1499789067913-23789, So call it: but it does fulfil my vow;  I needs must think it honesty. ,"Maybe so, but it's keeping my promise and therefore it's the right thing to do."

264,58128-1499789534313-45742," Sir,  The manner of your bearing towards him, with  What you as from your father shall deliver,  Things known betwixt us three, I'll write you down: ",I'll write down some instructions for how to behave toward him and will pack all the gifts you'll deliver on your father's behalf. 
265,58128-1499789540844-27749, The which shall point you forth at every sitting  What you must say; that he shall not perceive  But that you have your father's bosom there  And speak his very heart. ,All of it will support your story: that you've come to make peace between him and your father.
266,A-10597,  I am bound to you:There is some sap in this.  ,I'll do exactly as you say. This makes a lot of sense.
267,58130-1499789823902-98125," A cause more promising  Than a wild dedication of yourselves  To unpath'd waters, undream'd shores, most certain  To miseries enough; no hope to help you,  But as you shake off one to take another;  Nothing so certain as your anchors, who  Do their best office, if they can but stay you  Where you'll be loath to be: ","It's a better reason, at least, than your completely haphazard journey overseas with no plan, no trajectory, and no help, with no company but each other. Take care of each other. "
268,58130-1499789778242-39660," besides you know  Prosperity's the very bond of love,  Whose fresh complexion and whose heart together  Affliction alters. ","A heart full of love can make even the worst places bearable, and can bring a smile to your face even in the midst of suffering."
269,A-89520,"  One of these is true:I think affliction may subdue the cheek,But not take in the mind.  ","Part of what you say is true: I think suffering may wipe the smile from your face, but it can never change the state of your mind. "
270,A-28409,"  Yea, say you so?There shall not at your father's house theseseven yearsBe born another such.  ","Oh, you think so? You're one-in-a-million, shepherd girl. "
271,A-21472,"  My good Camillo,She is as forward of her breeding asShe is i' the rear our birth.  ","Camillo, she's so far beyond her lower-class origins; she's basically as noble as you and I."
272,A-45465,"  I cannot say 'tis pityShe lacks instructions, for she seems a mistressTo most that teach.  ","I would say ""it's too bad she hasn't had an education,"" but she seems more capable than most teachers I know."
273,A-22631,"  Your pardon, sir; for thisI'll blush you thanks.  ","I beg your pardon, sir. I'm embarrassed, but thank you."
274,58136-1499789863094-64468," My prettiest Perdita!  But O, the thorns we stand upon! ",My beautiful Perdita! But we're in a sticky situation. 
275,58136-1499789883072-58816," Camillo,  Preserver of my father, now of me,  The medicine of our house, how shall we do? ","Camillo, you've rescued my father and now me; you're a life-saver. What should we do? "
276,58136-1499789908233-2765," We are not furnish'd like Bohemia's son,  Nor shall appear in Sicilia. ","I don't have the clothes and facilities I normally travel with as the prince of Bohemia, and I won't be able to get those things in Sicily."
277,58137-1499789928013-39793," My lord,  Fear none of this: I think you know my fortunes  Do all lie there: ","Sir, don't worry. As you know, I have a lot of connections there. "
278,58137-1499789938026-61627, it shall be so my care  To have you royally appointed as if  The scene you play were mine. ,"I can make sure you're provided for, as surely as if I were there myself. "
279,58137-1499789945021-69073," For instance, sir,  That you may know you shall not want, one word. ","For example, sir—if I can ease your mind, talk with me for a moment."
280,58140-1499789960049-13164," Ha, ha! what a fool Honesty is! and Trust, his  sworn brother, a very simple gentleman! ","Ha, ha! Honest men are idiots, and people who trust me are just plain stupid."
281,58140-1499789977165-30137," I have sold  all my trumpery; not a counterfeit stone, not a  ribbon, glass, pomander, brooch, table-book, ballad,  knife, tape, glove, shoe-tie, bracelet, horn-ring,  to keep my pack from fasting: ","I've sold all my junk. I don't have a single fake gem, ribbon, mirror, perfume, jewelry, book, ballad, knife, belt, glove, shoelace, bracelet, or ring left in my bag. "
282,58140-1499789993539-19311," they throng who  should buy first, as if my trinkets had been  hallowed and brought a benediction to the buyer:  by which means I saw whose purse was best in  picture; and what I saw, to my good use I  remembered. ","They all swarmed to be the first to buy, as if my stuff were some kind of holy charm. I took note of where they kept their wallets and remembered that for later. "
283,58140-1499790011040-73925," My clown, who wants but something to  be a reasonable man, grew so in love with the  wenches' song, that he would not stir his pettitoes  till he had both tune and words; ","The shepherd's son (he's not all that bright, by the way) was so impressed with the girls' song that he wouldn't budge until he learned the tune and the words. "
284,58140-1499790069748-11112," which so drew the  rest of the herd to me that all their other senses  stuck in ears: you might have pinched a placket, it  was senseless; ","That was the best advertisement, since it sent all the others running to me to get the song for themselves. There was nothing you could do; everyone was singing this god-awful song, non-stop. "
285,58140-1499790087626-72716," 'twas nothing to geld a codpiece of a  purse; I could have filed keys off that hung in  chains: no hearing, no feeling, but my sir's song,  and admiring the nothing of it. So that in this  time of lethargy I picked and cut most of their  festival purses; ","While they were all lying around, I took the opportunity to pick their pockets and rifled through most of their purses. "
286,58140-1499790097906-76512," and had not the old man come in  with a whoo-bub against his daughter and the king's  son and scared my choughs from the chaff, I had not  left a purse alive in the whole army. ","If that old man hadn't come in and raised a ruckus about the shepherd's daughter and the prince, scaring everyone away, I wouldn't have left a single penny in anyone's wallet."
287,A-92744,"  Nay, but my letters, by this means being thereSo soon as you arrive, shall clear that doubt.  ","No, my letters will get there before you arrive and will clear up any doubt."
288,A-64518,  And those that you'll procure from King Leontes—  ,And the letters you'll get from King Leontes—
289,A-86198,  Shall satisfy your father.  ,—will satisfy your father.
290,A-50023,  Happy be you!All that you speak shows fair.  ,Thank you! You're so generous.
291,A-59352,"Who have we here?    We'll make an instrument of this, omitNothing may give us aid.",We'll make use of this; we can't overlook anything that might help us.
292,A-94192,"  If they have overheard me now, why, hanging.  ","If they just overheard me, I'm dead."
293,A-59974,"  How now, good fellow! why shakest thou so? Fearnot, man; here's no harm intended to thee.  ","Hello, sir! Why are you shaking? Don't be afraid; no one's going to hurt you."
294,A-49275,"  I am a poor fellow, sir.  ","I'm a poor man, sir."
295,58152-1499790179137-66281," Why, be so still; here's nobody will steal that from  thee: ","Calm down, no one here is going to steal from you. "
296,58152-1499790212323-32309," yet for the outside of thy poverty we must  make an exchange; therefore discase thee instantly,  —thou must think there's a necessity in't,—and  change garments with this gentleman: ","However, we would like to trade you for your poor man's clothes, so get undressed (it's necessary, you see) and change clothes with this gentleman. "
297,58152-1499790218687-20723," though the  pennyworth on his side be the worst, yet hold thee,  there's some boot. ","Though Florizel's getting the worst end of the deal already, we'll give you some money, too."
298,A-27646,"I am a poor fellow, sir.    I know ye well enough.","I'm a poor fellow, sir. I know exactly who you are."
299,A-82685,"  Nay, prithee, dispatch: the gentleman is halfflayed already.  ","Come on, now, get your clothes off. Florizel's half-stripped already."
300,A-73632,"Are you in earnest, sir?    I smell the trick on't.","Are you serious, sir? This must be a trick."
301,A-32565,"  Dispatch, I prithee.  ","Get on with it, please."
302,A-19514,"  Indeed, I have had earnest: but I cannot withconscience take it.  ","Ah, I can see you're serious, but I can't take your clothes in good conscience."
303,A-80469,"  Unbuckle, unbuckle.  ","Unbuckle, unbuckle."
304,58164-1499790253031-14286," Fortunate mistress,—let my prophecy  Come home to ye!— ","Perdita, I hope my plan works out for your sake! "
305,58164-1499790286600-50067," you must retire yourself  Into some covert: take your sweetheart's hat  And pluck it o'er your brows, muffle your face,  Dismantle you, and, as you can, ","You need to hide yourself for the time being. Take Florizel's hat and cover your face, change your clothes,"
306,58164-1499790294683-19838, disliken  The truth of your own seeming; that you may—  For I do fear eyes over—to shipboard  Get undescried. ,"and disguise yourself as much as possible. I'm afraid you're being watched, and you need to get onboard the ship undetected."
307,A-95009,  I see the play so liesThat I must bear a part.  ,I guess I'll play the part I've been given.
308,A-53471,  No remedy.Have you done there?  ,There's nothing we can do about it.  Are you all dressed?
309,A-27382,"  Should I now meet my father,He would not call me son.  ",My own father wouldn't recognize me now.
310,A-16381,"Nay, you shall have no hat.    Come, lady, come. Farewell, my friend.","No, you don't need a hat.  Goodbye, friend."
311,A-96198,"  Adieu, sir.  ","Goodbye, sir."
312,A-21615,"  O Perdita, what have we twain forgot!Pray you, a word.  ","Perdita, are we forgetting anything? Let's talk."
313,58173-1499790329305-2312," What I do next, shall be to tell the king  Of this escape and whither they are bound; ", Next I'll tell the king they escaped and where they're headed. 
314,58173-1499790341304-16609," Wherein my hope is I shall so prevail  To force him after: in whose company  I shall review Sicilia, for whose sight  I have a woman's longing. ","I'm hoping he'll go after them and that I'll get to come along to see my beloved country, Sicily."
315,A-23971,"  Fortune speed us!Thus we set on, Camillo, to the sea-side.  ","I pray we have a quick journey! Camillo, we're off to the seaside."
316,A-63411,  The swifter speed the better.  ,The quicker the better.
317,58177-1499790367835-44160," I understand the business, I hear it: to have an  open ear, a quick eye, and a nimble hand, is  necessary for a cut-purse; a good nose is requisite  also, to smell out work for the other senses. ","I see what's going on here. As a pickpocket, it's necessary to have an open ear, quick eye, fast hand—and a good nose, too, so you can smell out the good places to steal. "
318,58177-1499790382604-60818, I see  this is the time that the unjust man doth thrive.  What an exchange had this been without boot! What  a boot is here with this exchange! ,"This is a great time to be a criminal. He just traded me fancy clothes for my rags; I gained everything, and he gained nothing! "
319,58177-1499790394870-4596," Sure the gods do  this year connive at us, and we may do any thing  extempore. The prince himself is about a piece of  iniquity, stealing away from his father with his  clog at his heels: ","The gods have clearly given me permission to do whatever I want now. The prince himself is up to no good, running away from his father with his whore in tow."
320,58177-1499790402462-52940," if I thought it were a piece of  honesty to acquaint the king withal, I would not  do't: I hold it the more knavery to conceal it;  and therein am I constant to my profession. ","Even if it were a good deed to tell the king, I wouldn't do it. I think it's more crafty to keep it a secret, and since I'm a crook, I'll do just that. "
321,A-53532,"  Aside, aside; here is more matter for a hot brain:every lane's end, every shop, church, session,hanging, yields a careful man work.  ","But wait, there's more work to be done. Every street, store, church, meeting, and funeral can turn into an opportunity if you're savvy."
322,A-86032,"  See, see; what a man you are now!There is no other way but to tell the kingshe's a changeling and none of your flesh and blood.  ","Well, look where you are now! The only thing to do is to tell the king she's a changeling and not your biological daughter."
323,A-65811,"  Nay, but hear me.  ","No, listen to me."
324,A-26119,"  Nay, but hear me.  ","No, listen to me."
325,A-57941,"  Go to, then.  ","Go on, then."
326,58184-1499790445570-28828," She being none of your flesh and blood, your flesh  and blood has not offended the king; and so your  flesh and blood is not to be punished by him. ","Since she's not actually part of your family, your family hasn't offended the king, and your family can't be punished by him. "
327,58184-1499790455245-16160," Show  those things you found about her, those secret  things, all but what she has with her: ",Show him the things you found with her—all the things that you kept secret all these years (except for whatever she took with her). 
328,58184-1499790462150-49107," this being  done, let the law go whistle: I warrant you. ","Then, the law can have nothing to do with us, I promise you. "
329,58185-1499790481720-89436," I will tell the king all, every word, yea, and his  son's pranks too; ","I'll tell the king everything, every word. And I'll tell him about Florizel's tricks, too. "
330,58185-1499790491262-44035," who, I may say, is no honest man,  neither to his father nor to me, to go about to make  me the king's brother-in-law. ","He hasn't been very truthful to his father or to me, considering he was about to make me a king's brother-in-law."
331,A-68613,"  Indeed, brother-in-law was the farthest off youcould have been to him and then your blood had beenthe dearer by I know how much an ounce.  ","If they had actually gotten married and you were his brother-in-law by now, he'd hate you even more, and the price on your head would be even higher."
332,A-15740,"Very wisely, puppies!","Very smart, boys!"
333,A-84939,"  Well, let us to the king: there is that in thisfardel will make him scratch his beard.  ","Well, let's go to the king. The stuff in this bag will give him something to think about."
334,A-84547,I know not what impediment this complaintmay be to the flight of my master.,I'm not sure how this will get in the way of Florizel's departure.
335,A-61687,  Pray heartily he be at palace.  ,Let's hope he's at the palace.
336,A-43196,"How now, rustics! whither are you bound?","Hello, peasants! Where are you going?"
337,A-15496,"  To the palace, an it like your worship.  ","To the palace, if it please you, sir."
338,A-97542,"  Your affairs there, what, with whom, the conditionof that fardel, the place of your dwelling, yournames, your ages, of what having, breeding, and anything that is fitting to be known, discover.  ","Tell me what business you have there, and with whom. Tell me what's in that bag, where you live, your names, your ages, how much money you have, who your parents are, and anything else that I should know."
339,A-82734,"  We are but plain fellows, sir.  ","We're simple people, sir."
340,A-47275,"  A lie; you are rough and hairy. Let me have nolying: it becomes none but tradesmen, and theyoften give us soldiers the lie: but we pay them forit with stamped coin, not stabbing steel; thereforethey do not give us the lie.  ","That's a lie! You're rough and hairy. Don't lie to me. Only business people lie. But, since we soldiers pay them with money instead of pulling out our swords, they don't expose us for lying."
341,A-93270,"  Your worship had like to have given us one, if youhad not taken yourself with the manner.  ","It seemed like you were going to try to expose us for lying, but you've just revealed that you're the liar."
342,A-76474,"  Are you a courtier, an't like you, sir?  ","Are you a courtier or not, sir?"
343,58200-1499790576385-14006," Whether it like me or no, I am a courtier. Seest  thou not the air of the court in these enfoldings? ","Whether I like it or not, I'm a courtier. Can't you see my courtly clothes? "
344,58200-1499790613581-55856, hath not my gait in it the measure of the court?  receives not thy nose court-odor from me? ,Don't I walk like a courtier? Smell like one? 
345,58200-1499790623687-3264, reflect I  not on thy baseness court-contempt? ,Look down my nose at you like one? 
346,58200-1499790637915-95668," Thinkest thou,  for that I insinuate, or toaze from thee thy  business, I am therefore no courtier? ","Just because I'm asking you questions, you think I'm not a courtier? "
347,58200-1499790645897-59440, I am courtier  cap-a-pe; and one that will either push on or pluck  back thy business there: whereupon I command thee to  open thy affair. ,I'm a courtier from head to toe and I have the power to help you to court or to stop you right there. For that reason I command you to tell me everything.
348,A-59068,"  My business, sir, is to the king.  ","I have some business with the king, sir."
349,A-69444,  What advocate hast thou to him?  ,And who is pleading your case to him?
350,A-38562,"  I know not, an't like you.  ","I don't know, sir."
351,A-52696,  Advocate's the court-word for a pheasant: say youhave none.  ,"""Advocate"" is court-speak for ""pheasant;"" say you don't have one."
352,A-75954,"  None, sir; I have no pheasant, cock nor hen.  ","None, sir. I have no pheasant, male or female. "
353,A-54895,"  How blessed are we that are not simple men!Yet nature might have made me as these are,Therefore I will not disdain.  ","Thank God I'm not an idiot! But, since there but for the grace of God go I, I won't look down on them."
354,A-22368,  This cannot be but a great courtier.  ,He must be a really important courtier.
355,A-17709,"  His garments are rich, but he wearsthem not handsomely.  ","His clothes are fancy, but he's not wearing them elegantly."
356,A-29492,"  He seems to be the more noble in being fantastical:a great man, I'll warrant; I know by the pickingon's teeth.  ",The fact that he's a little crazy makes him seem even more noble. I could spot it a mile away.
357,A-53828,  The fardel there? what's i' the fardel?Wherefore that box?  ,What about the bag? What's in the bag? And why the box?
358,A-61461,"  Sir, there lies such secrets in this fardel and box,which none must know but the king; and which heshall know within this hour, if I may come to thespeech of him.  ","Sir, there are secrets in this bag and this box which are for the king alone. If I get the chance to speak to him, he'll know within the hour."
359,A-99716,"  Age, thou hast lost thy labour.  ","Old man, you're out of luck."
360,A-38193,"  Why, sir?  ","Why, sir?"
361,A-84944,"  The king is not at the palace; he is gone aboard anew ship to purge melancholy and air himself: for,if thou beest capable of things serious, thou mustknow the king is full of grief.  ",The king is not at the palace. He went aboard a new ship to escape his sadness. Understand? The king is grieving.
362,A-33932,"  So 'tis said, sir; about his son, that should havemarried a shepherd's daughter.  ","I've heard, sir, that he's grieving his son who almost married a shepherd's daughter."
363,A-43374,"  If that shepherd be not in hand-fast, let him fly:the curses he shall have, the tortures he shallfeel, will break the back of man, the heart of monster.  ","If that shepherd isn't in jail already, he better run for it. The punishment he faces will be enough to break any man."
364,A-43349,"  Think you so, sir?  ","Do you think so, sir?"
365,58218-1499790697155-31030," Not he alone shall suffer what wit can make heavy  and vengeance bitter; but those that are germane to  him, though removed fifty times, shall all come  under the hangman: ","He'll suffer horribly, but so will his family and everyone within fifty degrees of relation to him. They'll all be hanged; "
366,58218-1499790706932-2910," which though it be great pity,  yet it is necessary. An old sheep-whistling rogue a  ram-tender, to offer to have his daughter come into  grace! ","it's a pity, but it's necessary. Can you believe some old shepherd was grooming his daughter to catch a prince?"
367,58218-1499790714695-78574," Some say he shall be stoned; but that death  is too soft for him, say I draw our throne into a  sheep-cote! all deaths are too few, the sharpest too easy. ","Some say he'll be stoned to death, but I say that's too lenient for someone who almost ruined our prince! No punishment is too harsh for him."
368,A-88824,"  Has the old man e'er a son, sir, do you hear. an'tlike you, sir?  ","Have you heard anything about the old man having a son, sir? If it please you, sir?"
369,58220-1499790733066-46258," He has a son, who shall be flayed alive; then  'nointed over with honey, set on the head of a  wasp's nest; then stand till he be three quarters  and a dram dead; ","Oh, he has a son. He'll be skinned alive, drizzled in honey, thrown into a wasp's nest, and forced to stay there until he's nearly dead. "
370,58220-1499790748713-92086," then recovered again with  aqua-vitae or some other hot infusion; then, raw as  he is, and in the hottest day prognostication  proclaims, shall be be set against a brick-wall, the  sun looking with a southward eye upon him, where he  is to behold him with flies blown to death. ","Then they'll wake him up with a shot of whisky and stand him, raw flesh and all, on top of a brick wall to be baked in the sun and eaten by flies. "
371,58220-1499790779293-2975," But what  talk we of these traitorly rascals, whose miseries  are to be smiled at, their offences being so  capital? Tell me, for you seem to be honest plain  men, what you have to the king: ","But why are we talking about these backstabbing traitors? We should be thankful they're going to be put to death for their crimes! Since you seem to be humble peasants, tell me what you're bringing to the king. "
372,58220-1499790786934-34522," being something  gently considered, I'll bring you where he is  aboard, tender your persons to his presence,  whisper him in your behalfs; and if it be in man  besides the king to effect your suits, here is man  shall do it. ","If it's worth his attention, I'll bring you aboard his ship and introduce you to him with a kind recommendation. If there's anyone besides the king who can help you, it's me."
373,58221-1499790803821-64261, He seems to be of great authority: , He seems to have a lot of power.

What holier than, for royalty's repair,  For present comfort and for future good,  To bless the bed of majesty again  With a sweet fellow to't? ",We should thank God Hermione is in heaven now. Only good could come of a new queen: companionship for Leontes and the possibility of future princes and princesses.
12,58243-1499791174083-15205," There is none worthy,  Respecting her that's gone. Besides, the gods  Will have fulfill'd their secret purposes;  For has not the divine Apollo said,  Is't not the tenor of his oracle,  That King Leontes shall not have an heir  Till his lost child be found? ","No one but Hermione herself deserves that role. Besides, the gods intended this: didn't Apollo's oracle say that King Leontes would not have an heir until his lost child was found? "
13,58243-1499791187053-24349," which that it shall,  Is all as monstrous to our human reason  As my Antigonus to break his grave  And come again to me; who, on my life,  Did perish with the infant. ","It's about as likely that baby will return as it is that Antigonus, my husband (who died with it) will come back to life. "

45,58268-1499791715424-13759," Sir, you yourself  Have said and writ so, but your writing now  Is colder than that theme, 'She had not been,  Nor was not to be equall'd;'—thus your verse  Flow'd with her beauty once: 'tis shrewdly ebb'd,  To say you have seen a better. "," Sir, you yourself have said and written that ""Hermione was not, and will not be matched."" Considering how you used to rave about her beauty, you're doing her a disservice now to say you've seen someone more beautiful."

49,A-74808,  How! not women?  ,"Really? Women, too?"
50,A-67807,"  Women will love her, that she is a womanMore worth than any man; men, that she isThe rarest of all women.  ",Women will love her for being more worth their love than men. Men will love her because she's the most special woman that ever was.

They are come. ","Please, no more—stop. You know that hearing that is like seeing him die all over again. But your words will keep me in check when I see this young man. Here they come."
54,58276-1499791785455-38858," Your mother was most true to wedlock, prince;  For she did print your royal father off,  Conceiving you: ","Florizel, your mother should be proud: you look exactly like your father did when he was your age. "

63,58280-1499791962102-71990," And hath he too  Exposed this paragon to the fearful usage,  At least ungentle, of the dreadful Neptune,  To greet a man not worth her pains, much less  The adventure of her person? "," And has Polixenes put this beautiful girl through a long, uncomfortable boat journey just to see me, who's hardly worth the trouble?"

82,58292-1499792161617-68232," Never saw I  Wretches so quake: they kneel, they kiss the earth;  Forswear themselves as often as they speak:  Bohemia stops his ears, and threatens them  With divers deaths in death. ","I've never seen men so afraid: they kneel, kiss the ground, and swear every time they speak. Polixenes can hardly listen to them; he keeps threatening them with death."

","That ""once"" isn't likely to come to pass now that your father's on his way. I'm very sorry to hear that you're at odds with your father; you should be obedient to him.

90,58299-1499792198979-48207," Beseech you, sir,  Remember since you owed no more to time  Than I do now: with thought of such affections,  Step forth mine advocate; at your request  My father will grant precious things as trifles. "," Sir, I beg you—think of what you were like when you were my age and in love. Defend me to my father. If you ask, he'll give you an expensive gift as quickly as if it were a cheap one."

The way you're looking at her is hardly appropriate. Your queen, before she died, was much more beautiful than the girl you see now."
93,A-72462,"I thought of her,Even in these looks I made.    But your petitionIs yet unanswer'd. I will to your father:Your honour not o'erthrown by your desires,I am friend to them and you: upon which errandI now go toward him; therefore follow meAnd mark what way I make: come, good my lord.","I was thinking of her even while I looked at this young girl.

0,A-20021,"  Beseech you, sir, were you present at this relation?  ","And, sir, were you there when all this was said?"
1,A-67363,"  I was by at the opening of the fardel, heard the oldshepherd deliver the manner how he found it:whereupon, after a little amazedness, we were allcommanded out of the chamber; only this methought Iheard the shepherd say, he found the child.  ","I was there when they opened the bag, heard the old shepherd explain how he found it, and that's when, after a moment of shock, we were all told to leave. But I thought I heard the shepherd say that he found the child."
2,A-14264,  I would most gladly know the issue of it.  ,I'd love to know what happened next.
3,58310-1499793893496-24785, I make a broken delivery of the business; but the  changes I perceived in the king and Camillo were  very notes of admiration: ,"I'm not telling the story very well, but the king and Camillo seemed happy to see each other. "
4,58310-1499793916305-76196," they seemed almost, with  staring on one another, to tear the cases of their  eyes; there was speech in their dumbness, language  in their very gesture; they looked as they had heard  of a world ransomed, or one destroyed: a notable  passion of wonder appeared in them; ","They stared at each other so intensely it seemed like their eyes would pop out of their heads. They could hardly speak, but they said it all in their hugs and gestures. They looked like they'd seen the world rebuilt—or destroyed. They were filled with wonder. "
5,58310-1499793925357-52821," but the wisest  beholder, that knew no more but seeing, could not  say if the importance were joy or sorrow; but in the  extremity of the one, it must needs be. ","But no one who was watching could tell if they were joyful, or sad. It was the extreme version of one of those two."

7,A-23381,"Nothing but bonfires: the oracle is fulfilled; theking's daughter is found: such a deal of wonder isbroken out within this hour that ballad-makerscannot be able to express it.

The oracle is fulfilled, the king's daughter is found. So many wonderful things have happened in the last hour that even ballad-writers won't be able to express it. How are you, sir? This news sounds so much like a fairytale that it can hardly be true. Has the king found his heir?"
8,58316-1499794007936-13495," Most true, if ever truth were pregnant by  circumstance: that which you hear you'll swear you  see, there is such unity in the proofs. ","It's really true, if we can believe the circumstances. You might have to see the evidence to believe it: "
9,58316-1499794028684-54123," The mantle  of Queen Hermione's, her jewel about the neck of it,  the letters of Antigonus found with it which they  know to be his character, the majesty of the  creature in resemblance of the mother, the affection  of nobleness which nature shows above her breeding, ","Hermione's scarf, her necklace, letters in Antigonus's handwriting, the girl's resemblance to her mother, her obvious nobility which proves she's not a shepherdess . . . "
10,58316-1499794044241-89817, and many other evidences proclaim her with all  certainty to be the king's daughter. Did you see  the meeting of the two kings? ,all this and more proves that she's the king's daughter. Did you see the meeting of the two kings?
11,A-82806,  No.  ,No.
12,58318-1499794091738-52378," Then have you lost a sight, which was to be seen,  cannot be spoken of. There might you have beheld one  joy crown another, so and in such manner that it  seemed sorrow wept to take leave of them, for their  joy waded in tears. ",You missed a sight to be seen; I can't really explain it in words. They were so overjoyed that both of them were moved to tears. 
13,58318-1499794104745-22830," There was casting up of eyes,  holding up of hands, with countenances of such  distraction that they were to be known by garment,  not by favour. ",They looked up to heaven and held each other's hands. They looked so much alike that we could only tell them apart by their clothes! 
14,58318-1499794128960-96010," Our king, being ready to leap out of  himself for joy of his found daughter, as if that  joy were now become a loss, cries 'O, thy mother,  thy mother!' ","Leontes—who was about to leap out of his skin, he was so happy he found his daughter—cries out, ""Oh, your mother, your mother!"" as if the joy made his grief new, too. "

17,A-30408,"  What, pray you, became of Antigonus, that carriedhence the child?  ","What happened to Antigonus, who carried the baby to Bohemia?"
18,58320-1499794216251-83844," Like an old tale still, which will have matter to  rehearse, though credit be asleep and not an ear  open. ","That's like something out of a fairytale, too, which you won't believe no matter how many times I tell it. "

22,58322-1499794266311-14671, Wrecked the same instant of their master's death and  in the view of the shepherd: so that all the  instruments which aided to expose the child were  even then lost when it was found. ,"The shepherd saw them wreck at the same instant that Antigonus died, so everything that brought the child to them disappeared at the moment she was found. "
23,58322-1499794291656-60521," But O, the noble  combat that 'twixt joy and sorrow was fought in  Paulina! She had one eye declined for the loss of  her husband, another elevated that the oracle was  fulfilled: ","But poor Paulina—she was torn between joy and grief! She was crying for her husband, but rejoicing that the oracle was fulfilled. "

","She kept hugging the princess, as if she would hold her to her heart forever so that she'd never be lost again."
25,A-42896,  The dignity of this act was worth the audience ofkings and princes; for by such was it acted.  ,"Kings and princes could have watched a play like that, considering kings and princes were the actors."
26,58324-1499795088547-51781," One of the prettiest touches of all and that which  angled for mine eyes, caught the water though not  the fish, ",One of the most beautiful parts of it (it brought tears to my eyes) 
27,58324-1499795106284-61979," was when, at the relation of the queen's  death, with the manner how she came to't bravely  confessed and lamented by the king,  how  attentiveness wounded his daughter; till, from one  sign of dolour to another, she did, with an 'Alas,'  I would fain say, bleed tears, ","was when the king explained how the queen died, and the poor princess listened to the whole thing, crying, saying ""Oh, no!"" and practically bleeding tears."
28,58324-1499795113236-1534," for I am sure my  heart wept blood. Who was most marble there changed  colour; some swooned, all sorrowed: if all the world  could have seen 't, the woe had been universal. "," I think my heart wept blood. Even the most unemotional people there nearly fainted, and everyone cried. If the whole world had seen it, the sadness would have been universal."
29,A-35996,  Are they returned to the court?  ,Did they go back to the court?
30,58326-1499795141301-29582," No: the princess hearing of her mother's statue,  which is in the keeping of Paulina,— ","No, because the princess just heard about the statue of her mother, which Paulina has. "

","His ""Hermione"" statue looks so much like her that you'd be tempted to speak to it and wait for an answer. They've all hurried to see the statue, and they're planning to have dinner there."
33,A-45920,"  I thought she had some great matter there in hand;for she hath privately twice or thrice a day, eversince the death of Hermione, visited that removedhouse. Shall we thither and with our company piecethe rejoicing?  ","I thought she must have some important business in that isolated house, since she's visited it alone two or three times a day every day since Hermione's death.

Something incredible happens every time you blink! The longer we stay here, the less we'll see. Let's go."
35,58330-1499795232269-3247," Now, had I not the dash of my former life in me,  would preferment drop on my head. I brought the old  man and his son aboard the prince: ","If I weren't a thief, I'd be getting a promotion right about now. I brought the old man and his son onboard the prince's ship."

43,A-19271,"  I know you are now, sir, a gentleman born.  ","I know you are now, sir, born a gentleman."
44,A-65523,"  Ay, and have been so any time these four hours.  ","Yep, I was born a gentleman about four hours ago!"

57,A-18258,"  Not swear it, now I am a gentleman? Let boors andfranklins say it, I'll swear it.  ","I can't swear it, now that I'm a gentleman? If the peasants and the middle class can swear, I can swear, too."

2,58355-1499795707942-42822," but that you have vouchsafed,  With your crown'd brother and these your contracted  Heirs of your kingdoms, my poor house to visit,  It is a surplus of your grace, which never  My life may last to answer. ","and now you, Polixenes, Perdita, and Florizel have come to visit my little house. It's extremely gracious for you to be here, and I can never thank you enough."
3,58356-1499795723400-90779," O Paulina,  We honour you with trouble: ","Oh, Paulina, you know I'd do anything for you. "
4,58356-1499795735579-8298," but we came  To see the statue of our queen: your gallery  Have we pass'd through, not without much content  In many singularities; ","But I came to see the statue of my queen. But I've passed through your entire gallery—which was great, and all—"

6,58357-1499795760908-71410," As she lived peerless,  So her dead likeness, I do well believe,  Excels whatever yet you look'd upon  Or hand of man hath done; ","When Hermione was alive, no one was as beautiful as she was. It's the same with her statue; I'm sure you've never seen another man-made thing that's as perfect. "
7,58357-1499795772269-33640," therefore I keep it  Lonely, apart. But here it is: prepare  To see the life as lively mock'd as ever  Still sleep mock'd death: ",That's why I keep it hidden here.

9,58360-1499795797332-40614, Her natural posture! ,Exactly the way she used to stand! 
10,58360-1499795809173-64508," Chide me, dear stone, that I may say indeed  Thou art Hermione; or rather, thou art she  In thy not chiding, for she was as tender  As infancy and grace. "," Statue, if you would reprimand me, I'd say you were the real Hermione. Actually, you're more like her because you're not reprimanding me, considering she was as sweet as a baby and as gentle as grace itself. "
11,58360-1499795815817-16946," But yet, Paulina,  Hermione was not so much wrinkled, nothing  So aged as this seems. "," But, Paulina, Hermione didn't have that many wrinkles. She wasn't as old as this statue seems."
12,A-75364,"  O, not by much.  ",Not nearly as old.
13,A-13019,  So much the more our carver's excellence;Which lets go by some sixteen years and makes herAs she lived now.  ,"That's the sculptor's skill: he made her look like she would if she lived now, sixteen years later."

15,58363-1499795916733-1912," O, thus she stood,  Even with such life of majesty, warm life,  As now it coldly stands, when first I woo'd her! ","She looked just like this when I first fell in love with her, though she was warm and living, not cold and made of stone. "
16,58363-1499795927941-16921, I am ashamed: does not the stone rebuke me  For being more stone than it? ,I'm ashamed. Is the statue reprimanding me for being more stony and cold-hearted than it?
17,58363-1499795935074-96957," O royal piece,  There's magic in thy majesty, which has  My evils conjured to remembrance and  From thy admiring daughter took the spirits,  Standing like stone with thee. "," My queen, your magic has conjured up all the crimes I committed against you and your daughter, making me think neither of you could ever forgive me."

19,A-38728,"  O, patience!The statue is but newly fix'd, the colour's Not dry.  ","Oh, wait! The statue was just painted and it's not dry yet."

Unseemly woman in a seeming man,  And ill-beseeming beast in seeming both! ","Stop! Don’t do anything out of desperation. Are you a man? You look like a man. But your tears are womanly. Your wildness is like the irrational fury of a beast. You’re like an inappropriate woman hiding within a man, or, even worse, a shameful beast hiding within a half-man, half-woman!"
50,62505-1502962866008-31979," Thou hast amazed me. By my holy order,  I thought thy disposition better tempered.  Hast thou slain Tybalt?

"," The love that you swore is just a hollow lie, since you now threaten to kill the love that you vowed to cherish.

"," Now get a hold of yourself, man! Your Juliet is alive (for whose sake you were just threatening to kill yourself). That is something to be happy about. Tybalt tried to kill you, but you killed Tybalt. That is something to be happy about. The law that promised death for you was mercifully changed into exile—another thing to be happy about."

"," This pause shook me, entered into my conscience, yes, it almost split me in two and made my heart tremble. This thought forced its way into my conscience in such a way that many amazed considerations pushed and forced their way in along with it. "
69,47294-1503364898781-69533," First, methought  I stood not in the smile of heaven; who had  Commanded nature, that my lady's womb,  If it conceived a male child by me, should  Do no more offices of life to't than  The grave does to the dead; ","First, I thought God wasn't happy with me. He had commanded nature that, if a male child was conceived in my wife's womb by me, the womb would not give life to him but instead would be his grave. "
70,47294-1503364918784-90762," for her male issue  Or died where they were made, or shortly after  This world had air'd them: hence I took a thought,  This was a judgment on me; ",Her male children either died where they were conceived or shortly after they were born.

","and that my kingdom, which deserves the best heir in the world, would not get one from me to make it happy. Then I considered the danger my kingdom was in because I didn't have a child. And that made me groan and suffer. "
72,47294-1503364972494-35895," Thus hulling in  The wild sea of my conscience, I did steer  Toward this remedy, whereupon we are  Now present here together: ","So, thrown around in my conscience like a ship in a storm, I came up with this way to fix things that we are all engaged in today. "
73,47294-1503365010108-58835," that's to say,  I meant to rectify my conscience,—which  I then did feel full sick, and yet not well,—  By all the reverend fathers of the land  And doctors learn'd: ","That is, I wanted all the holy churchmen and learned academics in the country to cure my conscience, which felt sick then and isn't better yet."

So, continue. It was not because I disliked my good queen but because of the terrible reasons I just told you that this is happening. "

30,47686-1503414345442-62285," men so noble,  However faulty, yet should find respect  For what they have been: 'tis a cruelty  To load a falling man. ","Noble men, whatever their faults, should be respected for what they once were. It's cruel to kick a man when he's down."

1,A-17329,"  Now, tell me, Proteus, what's your will with me?  ","Now, what did you want to tell me, Proteus?"
2,57029-1502384379837-30937," My gracious lord, that which I would discover  The law of friendship bids me to conceal;  But when I call to mind your gracious favours  Done to me, undeserving as I am,  My duty pricks me on to utter that  Which else no worldly good should draw from me. ","My gracious lord, the rules of friendship tell me to keep certain things a secret. But when I remind myself of your kindness to me, my duty forces me to tell you a secret that nobody else could ever get out of me. "
3,57029-1502384407334-61821," Know, worthy prince, Sir Valentine, my friend,  This night intends to steal away your daughter:  Myself am one made privy to the plot.  I know you have determined to bestow her  On Turio, whom your gentle daughter hates;  And should she thus be stol'n away from you,  It would be much vexation to your age. ","My friend Sir Valentine is planning on stealing away with your daughter tonight. I have been entrusted with this secret information. I know you are determined to give her in marriage to Turio, whom your dear daughter hates. And if she were taken away from you like this, it would distress you—especially at your age."
4,57029-1502384416883-77231," Thus, for my duty's sake, I rather chose  To cross my friend in his intended drift  Than, by concealing it, heap on your head  A pack of sorrows which would press you down,  Being unprevented, to your timeless grave. "," So, for the sake of my duty, I would rather choose to go against my friend's intended plan than hide it. That way, you won't be weighed down with sorrow, which could easily kill you."
5,57030-1501699637968-444," Proteus, I thank thee for thine honest care;  Which to requite, command me while I live. ","Proteus, I thank you for your honesty and care. To repay you, ask any favor of me while I'm still alive. "
6,57030-1502464893657-45043," This love of theirs myself have often seen,  Haply when they have judged me fast asleep,  And oftentimes have purposed to forbid  Sir Valentine her company and my court: ","I have often seen signs that Valentine and Silvia are in love, usually while they think I'm sleeping. And I have often thought of forbidding Sir Valentine to see her, and of banishing him from my court. "
7,57030-1502464914598-14110," But fearing lest my jealous aim might err  And so unworthily disgrace the man, ","But I was worried that my suspicions may be wrong, which would unfairly shame him. "
8,57030-1502464934384-774," A rashness that I ever yet have shunn'd,  I gave him gentle looks, thereby to find  That which thyself hast now disclosed to me. ","I put that rash decision out of my mind, and I looked upon him kindly in order to try and discover the information which you have just told me. "
9,57030-1502464961120-51791," And, that thou mayst perceive my fear of this,  Knowing that tender youth is soon suggested, ","You can guess that this causes me to worry about her. And knowing how young people are easily tempted, "
10,57030-1502464967784-36743," I nightly lodge her in an upper tower,  The key whereof myself have ever kept;  And thence she cannot be convey'd away. ","I keep her in a high tower every night, and I hold onto the key so she can't be taken away."
11,57031-1502384909665-16231," Know, noble lord, they have devised a mean  How he her chamber-window will ascend  And with a corded ladder fetch her down; ","But, noble lord, they have come up with a plan to use a rope ladder—he'll climb up it to get to the window of her room, and will bring her down. "
12,57031-1501699829911-21533," For which the youthful lover now is gone  And this way comes he with it presently;  Where, if it please you, you may intercept him. ","The young man has just left to get that ladder, and he will soon come this way with it. If you wish, you may catch him bringing it here. "
13,57031-1502465070691-69866," But, good my Lord, do it so cunningly  That my discovery be not aimed at;  For love of you, not hate unto my friend,  Hath made me publisher of this pretence. ","But, my good lord, do it cleverly, so that I am not suspected of disclosing his secret plan. My love for you—not hatred of my friend—made me reveal his intention."
14,A-14789,"  Upon mine honour, he shall never knowThat I had any light from thee of this.  ",I swear on my honor that he will never know that I heard any of this from you.
15,A-90292,"  Adieu, my Lord; Sir Valentine is coming.  ","Goodbye, my Lord. Sir Valentine is coming!"
16,A-62679,"  Sir Valentine, whither away so fast?  ","Sir Valentine, where are you going so fast?"
17,A-41398,"  Please it your grace, there is a messengerThat stays to bear my letters to my friends,And I am going to deliver them.  ","I am sorry, your Grace. There is a messenger that is waiting to take my letters to my friends, and I'm going to give them to him."
18,A-66552,  Be they of much import?  ,Are these letters important?
19,A-75389,  The tenor of them doth but signifyMy health and happy being at your court.  ,"They just talk of my health, and how happy I am at your court."
20,57040-1502385028448-98864," Nay then, no matter; stay with me awhile;  I am to break with thee of some affairs  That touch me near, wherein thou must be secret. ","Then they are not so important. Stay with me for a while. I want to tell you about some things that are close to my heart, and you must keep them secret. "
21,57040-1501699937554-41787, 'Tis not unknown to thee that I have sought  To match my friend Sir Turio to my daughter. ,You know yourself that I have been trying to make a match between my friend Sir Turio and my daughter.
22,57041-1501699976691-84741," I know it well, my Lord; and, sure, the match  Were rich and honourable; ","I know that well, my Lord. And that match is rich and honorable, of course. "
23,57041-1502466310194-7781," besides, the gentleman  Is full of virtue, bounty, worth and qualities  Beseeming such a wife as your fair daughter: ","Also, the gentleman is virtuous, generous,  and worthy. And he has all the right qualities that are suitable for such a wife as your beautiful daughter will be. "
24,57041-1502466331792-51670, Cannot your Grace win her to fancy him? ,"Can't you win her over so she likes him, your Grace?"
25,57042-1505239365436-62197," No, trust me; she is peevish, sullen, froward,  Proud, disobedient, stubborn, ","No, trust me. She is headstrong, sour, obstinate, proud, disobedient, and stubborn. "
26,57042-1505239373043-76090," lacking duty,  Neither regarding that she is my child  Nor fearing me as if I were her father; ","She doesn't respect the duty that she owes me as my child, and doesn't fear my parental authority. "
27,57042-1505239381482-84524," And, may I say to thee, this pride of hers,  Upon advice, hath drawn my love from her; ","And, I can tell you this, after thinking it over, this pride of hers has turned my love away from her."
28,57042-1505239390954-43593," And, where I thought the remnant of mine age  Should have been cherish'd by her child-like duty, "," I thought that, in my old age, she might cherish me and be dutiful to me."
29,57042-1505239405968-26335, I now am full resolved to take a wife  And turn her out to who will take her in: ," But now I have decided to get a wife, and shun my daughter, so anyone can take her in. "
30,57042-1501700099180-35536, Then let her beauty be her wedding-dower;  For me and my possessions she esteems not. ,"Then, let her beauty be her dowry. She is not worth me and my possessions. "
31,A-41405,  What would your Grace have me to do in this?  ,"Your Grace, what do you want me to do about this?"
32,57044-1502394581832-89563, There is a lady in Verona here  Whom I affect; but she is nice and coy  And nought esteems my aged eloquence: ,"There is a lady here in Verona whom I love. But she is reluctant and shy, and does not care to speak of love with me, an old man. "
33,57044-1502385211361-79050," Now therefore would I have thee to my tutor—  For long agone I have forgot to court;  Besides, the fashion of the time is changed— ","I'd like you to be my tutor, since it's been a while and I have forgotten how to woo. And the fashion of the time has changed too."
34,57044-1502385448915-47655, How and which way I may bestow myself  To be regarded in her sun-bright eye. , Tell me how and in what way I should behave to be well-regarded in her eyes.
35,A-12973,"  Win her with gifts, if she respect not words:Dumb jewels often in their silent kindMore than quick words do move a woman's mind.  ","Win her with gifts, if she doesn't care for words. Jewels often influence a woman's mind; they're silent, but jewels move a woman quicker than words ever could."
36,A-61503,  But she did scorn a present that I sent her.  ,But she refused a gift that I sent her.
37,57047-1501700384918-42968, A woman sometimes scorns what best contents her.  Send her another; never give her o'er;  For scorn at first makes after-love the more. ,A woman sometimes refuses what she likes the best. Send her another gift; don't give up on her. Refusal at first makes later love greater. 
38,57047-1502385563737-79230," If she do frown, 'tis not in hate of you,  But rather to beget more love in you:  If she do chide, 'tis not to have you gone;  For why, the fools are mad, if left alone. ","If she frowns, it's not because she hates you. Instead, she wants to get more love out of you. If she tells you off, it's not because she wants you to stop or go away. These foolish women go crazy when they are left alone. "
39,57047-1502385660491-20943," Take no repulse, whatever she doth say;  For 'get you gone,' she doth not mean 'away!'  Flatter and praise, commend, extol their graces;  Though ne'er so black, say they have angels' faces. ","Don't take her refusals seriously, no matter what she says. When she says ""leave,"" she doesn't necessarily mean ""go away."" Flatter her, praise her, elaborate on all her virtues. However dark-complexioned women may be, say that they have angels' faces."
40,57047-1502385668005-44043," That man that hath a tongue, I say, is no man,  If with his tongue he cannot win a woman  . ", I think that a man that has a tongue is no man at all if he can't use his tongue to win a woman.
41,57048-1501700452664-87744," But she I mean is promised by her friends  Unto a youthful gentleman of worth, ","But her family has promised to marry her to some young, worthy gentleman."
42,57048-1501700460222-44510," And kept severely from resort of men,  That no man hath access by day to her. "," She is kept away from any other men, so that no man has access to her during the day."
43,A-89196,"  Why, then, I would resort to her by night.  ","Well then, I would go to her at night."
44,A-13480,"  Ay, but the doors be lock'd and keys kept safe,That no man hath recourse to her by night.  ","Yes, but her door is locked. And the keys are kept safely tucked away, so that no man can get to her at night."
45,A-74863,  What lets but one may enter at her window?  ,What prevents you from entering her room through her window?
46,A-15568,"  Her chamber is aloft, far from the ground,And built so shelving that one cannot climb itWithout apparent hazard of his life.  ","Her room is up high, quite far from the ground. And it's built in a way that you can't climb up without endangering your life. "
47,A-90473,"  Why then, a ladder quaintly made of cords,To cast up, with a pair of anchoring hooks,Would serve to scale another Hero's tower,So bold Leander would adventure it.  ","Well, then a ladder made out of ropes could be thrown up to her, and set with a pair of heavy hooks. These would work to get to another Hero's tower, so bold Leander would try to reach her."
48,A-65161,"  Now, as thou art a gentleman of blood,Advise me where I may have such a ladder.  ","Now, since you are a gentleman from a good family, tell me where I may find such a ladder. "
49,A-81662,"  When would you use it? Pray, sir, tell me that.  ","When would you need it? Please tell me when, sir. "
50,A-97802,"  This very night; for Love is like a child,That longs for every thing that he can come by.  ",Tonight! Because Love is like a child. It wants everything that  it can get. 
51,A-92276,  By seven o'clock I'll get you such a ladder.  ,I'll get you this ladder by seven o'clock.
52,A-59798,"  But, hark thee; I will go to her alone:How shall I best convey the ladder thither?  ","But, wait. I will be going to her alone, so how can I carry the ladder there?"
53,A-74298,"  It will be light, my lord, that you may bear itUnder a cloak that is of any length.  ","It's not heavy, my lord. And you can hide it under any coat, long or short. "
54,A-85434,  A cloak as long as thine will serve the turn?  ,Would a coat as long as yours work?
55,A-58268,"  Ay, my good lord.  ","Yes, my good lord."
56,A-80680,  Then let me see thy cloak:I'll get me one of such another length.  ,Then let me see your coat. I'll get one of this length for myself.
57,A-53721,"  Why, any cloak will serve the turn, my lord.  ","Any coat will be work, my lord."
58,57064-1502460124511-12510," How shall I fashion me to wear a cloak?  I pray thee, let me feel thy cloak upon me. ","How can I get used to wearing a coat? Please, let me try yours. [He tries on the coat and finds a letter] "
59,57064-1502460137406-84113, What letter is this same? What's here? 'To Silvia'! ,"What's this letter? What does it say? [Reading]""To Silvia!"" "
60,57064-1502460145134-34157, And here an engine fit for my proceeding.  I'll be so bold to break the seal for once. ,This is a device suitable for the very scheme I have been planning. I'll be so bold as to break the seal for once.
61,57066-1505241077459-27448," 'My thoughts do harbour with my Silvia nightly,  And slaves they are to me that send them flying: ","[Reading]""My thoughts take refuge with my Silvia every night, and whoever sends those thoughts flying are like scoundrels to me. "
62,57066-1502463037100-89683," O, could their master come and go as lightly,  Himself would lodge where senseless they are lying! "," Oh, if only I could come and go as easily my thoughts. Then I would choose to stay where all my thoughts of Silvia reside imperceptibly within my mind. "
63,57066-1502480160043-49177," My herald thoughts in thy pure bosom rest them:  While I, their king, that hither them importune,  Do curse the grace that with such grace hath bless'd them,  Because myself do want my servants' fortune: ","My thoughts are like messages delivered to your pure heart. I—their sender—urge them to go there. But I also curse the good fortune that my thoughts have been blessed with, because I long to be as lucky as they are. "
64,57066-1502461230610-8969," I curse myself, for they are sent by me,  That they should harbour where their lord would be.' ","I curse myself because even though I'm the one who sent them, I can't be where they get to be—with you."""
65,57066-1502461384980-9341," What's here?  'Silvia, this night I will enfranchise thee.'  'Tis so; and here's the ladder for the purpose.  Why, Phaeton,—for thou art Merops' son,—  Wilt thou aspire to guide the heavenly car  And with thy daring folly burn the world? "," What's this here? [Reading]""Silvia, I will free you tonight."" Is that so? And here is the ladder for that purpose. Are you like Phateon, Merops' son, and will you hope to drive the heavenly chariot and burn the world with your daring foolishness? "
66,57066-1502463658591-18112," Wilt thou reach stars, because they shine on thee?  Go, base intruder! Overweening slave! ","Will you reach the stars because they shine on you? Go, you lowly invader! You arrogant scoundrel! "
67,57066-1504392510676-63177," Bestow thy fawning smiles on equal mates,  And think my patience, more than thy desert,  Is privilege for thy departure hence: ",Give your smiles to women of your own worth. I hope you know that it is because of my patience—and not because you deserve it in any way—that I'm allowing you to leave. 
68,57066-1502461716137-35710, Thank me for this more than for all the favours  Which all too much I have bestow'd on thee. ,Thank me for this more than for all the kind things I've done for you—of which there have been far too many. 
69,57066-1502461616349-35453," But if thou linger in my territories  Longer than swiftest expedition  Will give thee time to leave our royal court,  By heaven! My wrath shall far exceed the love  I ever bore my daughter or thyself. ","But, if you stay behind in my lands longer than the short time that I'll give you to leave my royal court, I swear to God that my anger will be stronger than the love I've ever had for my daughter or for you. "
70,57066-1502461631082-45016," Be gone! I will not hear thy vain excuse;  But, as thou lovest thy life, make speed from hence. ","Get out of here! I don't want to hear any of your excuses. If you love your life, you'd better get out of here as fast as possible. "
71,57068-1501701164855-4186, And why not death rather than living torment?  To die is to be banish'd from myself;  And Silvia is myself: banish'd from her  Is self from self: a deadly banishment! ,"And why don't I die rather than live in torment? To die is to be banished from myself, and Silvia is myself. Being banished from her is like being banished from myself. That's a deadly banishment! "
72,57068-1502386769497-80054," What light is light, if Silvia be not seen?  What joy is joy, if Silvia be not by?  Unless it be to think that she is by  And feed upon the shadow of perfection ","What light is light, if Silvia can't be seen? What joy is joy, if Silvia isn't nearby? Unless joy is to simply think that she is nearby and feed on that image of perfection."
73,57068-1502386809950-88708," Except I be by Silvia in the night,  There is no music in the nightingale;  Unless I look on Silvia in the day,  There is no day for me to look upon; ","If I'm not by Silvia during the night, then the nightingale doesn't sing. Unless I look at Silvia during the day, there is no day for me to see. "
74,57068-1501701217421-2745," She is my essence, and I leave to be,  If I be not by her fair influence  Foster'd, illumined, cherish'd, kept alive. ","She is my everything, and I will cease to exist if I am not nurtured, illuminated, comforted, and kept alive by her power. "
75,57068-1504392616070-43060," I fly not death, to fly his deadly doom:  Tarry I here, I but attend on death:  But, fly I hence, I fly away from life. ","It'll be as bad as dying under his death sentence if I run away. But, I will flee—even though I'll be fleeing from life itself. "
76,A-53593,"  Run, boy, run, run, and seek him out.  ","Run, boy, run, run; and look for him."

79,A-81646,  Him we go to find: there's not a hair on's headbut 'tis a Valentine.  ,"I found the man we wanted to find. Look, I swear that every hair on that man's head belongs to Valentine."
80,A-51523,  Valentine?  ,Valentine?
81,A-80015,  No.  ,No.
82,A-82379,  Who then? His spirit?  ,Who then? His ghost?

89,A-27149,"  Villain, forbear.  ","Rogue, stand by."
90,A-32687,"  Why, sir, I'll strike nothing: I pray you,—  ","But sir, I won't hit anything, I swear— "
91,A-96010,"  Sirrah, I say, forbear. Friend Valentine, a word.  ","I said, stand by, sir.  Valentine, my friend, speak to me."
92,A-93535,"  My ears are stopt and cannot hear good news,So much of bad already hath possess'd them.  ","My ears are blocked up and can't hear good news, since they have been packed with so much bad news already."

95,A-56934,"  No, Valentine.  ","No, Valentine."
96,A-27379,"  No Valentine, indeed, for sacred Silvia.Hath she forsworn me?  ","Then, indeed, there will be no Valentine for sacred Silvia. Has she rejected me?"
97,A-84649,"  No, Valentine.  ","No, Valentine."
98,A-38444,"  No Valentine, if Silvia have forsworn me.What is your news?  ","There will be no Valentine, if Silvia has rejected me. What is your news?"
99,A-54568,"  Sir, there is a proclamation that you are vanished.  ","Sir, it has been announced that you are vanished."
100,A-22160,"  That thou art banished—O, that's the news!—From hence, from Silvia and from me thy friend.  ","That you are banished! Oh, that's the news! Banished from here, from Silvia and from me, your friend. "
101,A-85630,"  O, I have fed upon this woe already,And now excess of it will make me surfeit.Doth Silvia know that I am banished?  ","Oh, I have already heard this bad news—and now more of it will make me ill. Does Silvia know that I am banished? "
102,57096-1502387139473-97002," Ay, ay; and she hath offer'd to the doom—  Which, unreversed, stands in effectual force—  A sea of melting pearl, which some call tears: ","Yes, yes, and her reaction to the sentence—which, as long as it's not reversed, will be as powerful as ever—was a sea of tears.

103,57096-1505241663967-14322," Those at her father's churlish feet she tender'd;  With them, upon her knees, her humble self;  Wringing her hands, whose whiteness so became them  As if but now they waxed pale for woe: ","She offered them and her whole self at her father's feet, begging on her knees. She was wringing her hands, which were so white it was like they had just gone pale with sadness. "
104,57096-1502387163004-30436," But neither bended knees, pure hands held up,  Sad sighs, deep groans, nor silver-shedding tears,  Could penetrate her uncompassionate sire;  But Valentine, if he be ta'en, must die. ","But neither her knees, nor her hands held up. Her sad sighs, deep groans, and tears couldn't reach out to her unfeeling father. But, if you are taken, you will die."
105,57096-1501701723286-13272," Besides, her intercession chafed him so,  When she for thy repeal was suppliant,  That to close prison he commanded her,  With many bitter threats of biding there. "," Also, her prayer—in which she asked for the reversal of your sentence—made her father so angry that he locked her up in a secluded prison. He made many awful threats if she didn't stay there."
106,57097-1502387265583-1898, No more; unless the next word that thou speak'st  Have some malignant power upon my life: ,"Say no more, unless your next word has some evil power over my life. "
107,57097-1504392870693-91990," If so, I pray thee, breathe it in mine ear,  As ending anthem of my endless dolour. ","If so, then I ask you, whisper it in my ear, like a tune playing at my funeral, to remember my endless suffering. "
108,57098-1502387396333-68153," Cease to lament for that thou canst not help,  And study help for that which thou lament'st.  Time is the nurse and breeder of all good.  Here if thou stay, thou canst not see thy love;  Besides, thy staying will abridge thy life. ","Stop moaning; that won't help you.
